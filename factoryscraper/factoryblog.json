{"page_num": "3", "name": "Friday Facts #369 - To the moon 🚀🌘", "body": "This post was written as a joke for April Fools' day. Nothing written here should be taken seriously.  No doubt you have heard about NFTs, the latest Blockchain innovation. With some big gaming companies exploring NFTs, where does Factorio stand?  We have received many offers. Some of the offers were quite silly, others very tempting.\r Since we have many Blockchain enthusiasts on the team, we decided to explore the subject ourselves. After consulting with some industry-leading experts on Discord, this is what we came up with:\r  Non-fungible blueprints \r One of the many subjects of debate within the team is the blueprint library. Allowing players to easily share big blueprints (blue science, nuclear reactor setup, etc.) ruins the fun of figuring out how to build those things yourself. One of the best things about the blueprint library is that it contains your unique blueprints, which are almost like unique pieces of art. So it only makes sense to make them truly unique, using the Blockchain, NFT, and Smart Contracts technologies.\r  \r What this means is that every blueprint in the blueprint library will now be stored on the Blockchain, and they will be truly unique across all of the blueprint libraries of all players. Just like NFTs, they can be traded on the Blockchain, also making them a great speculative asset. In essence your blueprint library will become your personal wallet, containing only the unique blueprints that you own. Unlike most NFTs, blueprints are created (minted) by the players, making it a truly decentralized system, controlled by the smart contracts we created.\r     \r In order to guarantee uniqueness we will use AI and Machine Deep Learning to analyze any new blueprint before it is minted, this way you won't be able to just move one power pole and mint a copy. Once again, making blueprints truly unique.\r  Our own Play-to-earn cryptocurrency \r Limiting the creation (minting) of new blueprints using just the AI will not be enough. To ensure the Blockchain is not flooded with useless blueprints, we will also create a cryptocurrency called Factorio Blueprint Token ⚙️. You will need to pay 1,000 of them to mint 1 new unique blueprint. Factorio Blueprint Tokens ⚙️ are earned from Space Science using a variable conversion rate we will control. Since you can now earn crypto by just playing the game, the game basically pays for itself.\r  \r Factorio Blueprint Tokens ⚙️ come with all the advantages of a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, and all the fun of playing Factorio and optimizing factories for maximum UPS. Some say that Factorio offers so much value for money, that they paid more for the electricity bill than they paid for the game, so we are happy to take it to the next level.\r  \r We will host an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for Factorio Blueprint Token ⚙️, so make sure you invest as much as you can and HODL it, in the hopes that someone will tweet about it making the price go to the moon 🚀🌘.

Naturally we asked ourselves what else could we use this new technology for...  We've dreamed about this multiple times in the past, but the technical roadblocks didn't make us think too seriously. We'd like the main menu background to be a real animated simulation of the game, similar to what Transport Tycoon or Rollercoaster Tycoon games have.  Instead of things like cinematic trailers, we always present the game in its true form, and the menu background does not follow this logic. Also, any time we improve any graphics, a static image immediately gets older while a real game simulation is updated automatically.  We've created a variety of scenes that each demonstrate some feature(s) of the game, from first miners all the way to the artillery and Spidertron. The screen is quite zoomed in and the factories are rather small, so it's more of a demonstration of the game's features rather than a showcase of \"the best things anybody has ever built\".  The scenes are randomly rotated, where all of them have to play once before any repeat.    The main menu should include both Factorio and Wube software logos.  The Factorio logo has been used in many places from prints to trailers many times already. Its concept is that the logo is an entity like any other, and integrates itself into the world by being built there if at all possible.  The Wube logo is different, both graphically and in concept, so we can't represent it as an entity. It makes a lot of sense that Wube is in a layer underneath the world of Factorio, so we're using it as a special water tile.    From now on, the Factorio entity and Wube water tile are both buildable in the map editor without the use of mods. The \"water-wube\" only works well in specific positions, as it repeats in a 8x8 tile pattern, so fitting it in an existing factory can be tricky.  To make it clear that behind the menu is not your factory, every scene has the logos in the exact same position, and the screen has a vignette-like shader on the edges.

Something that would really work against that would be if the update broke a bunch of mods and disgruntled all of our most dedicated players. So we are making efforts to ensure that mods that work in 0.18, will work without any update needed in 1.0.  Theoretically this isn't so difficult, as the 0.18 release structure has meant that mods have maintained compatibility with all the latest changes, and in essence 1.0 will just be a small update of 0.18. However it does take a bit of special handling:\r  1.0 will allow mods marked for 0.18 to load. The mod portal will show 0.18 mods when browsing in 1.0.  Avoiding breaking mods also means we need to be very careful with changing anything, even something as simple as renaming a sprite can break dozens of mods. I think we never realised how easy it is to break mods before we started this new release structure. Big apologies and big thanks to all the modders who stuck with us through these breakages.  We hope that what this effort means, is that on the day of 1.0, players new and old alike can login to the mod portal and have a very large catalog of mods they can enjoy right away, and that the modders can relax and enjoy the game instead of worrying about updating all their work.

Most were small, such as replacing \"can't\" with \"cannot\", things like that. It was the exact sort of external scrutiny we really needed, as it showed some areas where we were quite inconsistent. It feels like things are in a better place now, even if the majority of changes are relatively unnoticeable.  However it was very noticeable to our great community translators on Crowdin. When we update the English strings, the translations have to be updated on Crowdin. For the last few days I've been working through the issues raised on Crowdin, and there was a lot of good input on that last 1% of the changes.  So this concludes the 'English proofreading' phase. Starting on Monday, Altagram will start proofreading the target languages, and filling in any missing strings where needed. This should take about 3 weeks. Since Altagram has their own translation system for their team, it isn't really feasible to include Crowdin in this part of the work, they will just take the content from Crowdin at the start of the process, and after 3 weeks, push what they have back to Crowdin. So any translation work by volunteers on Crowdin for these 3 weeks would be wasted. So we ask that, if you want to volunteer your time, save it for a little while.  Any work done on Crowdin this weekend will be included. We deliberately made this buffer between the English corrections and the Target proofreading so that the players on Crowdin have an opportunity to contribute before Altagram starts.  After Altagram has pushed their corrections back to Crowdin, we will start the 'Community review' part of the process. This is when the work that Altagram's team has done is reviewed by players and feedback is given to Altagram via Crowdin issues. This helps us make sure the terms of the translations are consistent with the established community usage, and ensure there are no contextual issues or misunderstandings.

There's no doubt this is the most important effort here: we're all here to play the game. At the same time, the website is often the first thing people encounter—and in for many, return to every week! Unfortunately, until this point the looks of our websites have been neglected. The current set of websites are a complete mishmash of styles that are not coherent and do not fit with the look of the game.  Which website am I looking at again?  We set out to rework the looks of our websites last year to make them harmonize with the final game.  Albert and Aleš worked together to design the new website and make mockups in a process not too dissimilar to the GUI work in the game. Of course, web technology is a different beast from anything the game uses. My task was to take the mockups for each page and implement them as closely as possible (my own creative liberties notwithstanding).  The process from original page to mockup to the new version  My approach to creating websites is conservative, and in a way mirrors the philosophy we use when developing the game. The Factorio website doesn't use a fancy modern JavaScript framework. I'm not a JavaScript hater. There is no harm in using JavaScript to make parts of the website interactive, and of course many web applications wouldn't be possible with it. But for a website like ours, avoiding the use of bloated JavaScript frameworks helps keep everything load and render quickly, and of course the website can be browsed without JavaScript as well.  To get the looks right, I set out to create a CSS framework to visually mimic the Factorio GUI style. Where possible, I avoided the use of images. This keeps the page fast and ensures it stays sharp on all resolutions and levels of zoom.  For instance, the buttons match their game counterparts closely, but are made only using shadows.    The only exception is the arrow facing to the right, which simply isn't possible to reproduce using CSS (I tried!). However, even then the performance is kept slick because the graphics for it are embedded in the stylesheet.  The layout for new pages with sleek grids is enabled thanks to modern CSS technologies like Flexbox and CSS grid (no floats, no tables).    At the same time, the mod portal also received the new design.    I also took the effort to unify login sessions between the main website and the mod portal, so you no longer have to log in twice.  This Friday Facts is the last time you're seeing the current (old) style, so enjoy it while it lasts! The new website will go live sometime next week.

In the rather recent FFF-339, Albert presented the updated and redesigned Beacon. After your responses we realized some issues we hadn’t seen with the Beacon before, and we have taken some time to think about it...    The red tower design by itself is very impressive, which gave it so many plus points that we didn't focus enough on the fact that it is taking too much visual attention. In this case, this happens because of aggressive red colours, the big contrasty yellow eye-like circle, the entity being quite tall, and the electric beam animation. Random variations are usually helpful to make entities look nicer in clumps (like resources), but not in this case, especially as other built entities don’t have any variations.  The options to take from here would be to either update the original design, adjust the red tower, or start a new redesign.    The Beacon is a very special entity, either it doesn’t appear in a factory at all or very little, or it’s everywhere. It doesn’t really do anything by itself so it doesn’t really need to show much activity either.  The original design has its own problems and also saturates the screen very quickly, as they are bright, also tall, and they always move, attracting attention to the movement constantly.  As for the red tower, most of the top part would have to be removed which is almost a complete redesign already, but parts of the hole could be recycled for a new version...

{"page_num": "6", "name": "Friday Facts #345 - Unit group collision mask & Artillery shell particle", "body": "Unit group collision mask  Last weekend, a bug report came in on our forum. The issue was that the groups of biters were trying to path over the water, but the bugs can't swim.    It seemed like something quite typical of a mod being funky. I looked into it, and it seems the Hovercraft mod was playing monkey business with water collision masks to make his vehicles ride over water. One thing involved setting water tiles to be walkable, and then adding an additional collision layer to all players and biters.  What this modder didn't realise though, is that unit groups have a fixed collision mask. It used to be hardcoded, but a while ago it was added to the utility constants. So we just say \"hey its a mod problem, here's a quarter, call someone who cares\"... right?  Well it didn't sit right with me, because deep inside I knew that the unit groups shouldn't have a fixed collision mask, it doesn't make sense really. Lets say you add flying units to the game. If you give individual commands to the flyers to go attack the base, they will happily fly over the water and attack without issue. However if you put them in a group together, a group of flying units, the group will path around the water, because the unit group still has a fixed ground collision mask.  So this week I decided to fix it once and for all. It turns out it wasn't so hard in the end. As we mentioned somewhat in FFF-340, unit groups already have logic in place to recalculate their properties based on their members. I hooked into that logic to also make them recalculate their collision mask.  The way that made sense to me, is that they should add the masks together, so that they only path where all of the units can path.  A group of only small biters, they can't walk on water, so they walk around it.  A group of 'water biters'. They can walk right over water, so they go straight through.  A mixed group of small biters and water biters. They add their masks together, so only go where all the units can go.  You can imagine it quite intuitively I think, the group will try to stick together, and that will mean the group can only path to places that all the members can reach.  It feels quite nice to make fixes like this, as they are relatively small in scope and risk, but cleanup a lot of potential problems, and open a lot of interesting possibilities.

{"page_num": "6", "name": "Friday Facts #344 - Tile transition collisions & Team Steelaxe speedrun record", "body": "Tile transition collisions Klonan  We first mentioned a change to our tile transition logic back in FFF-199, and not long after in FFF-214. These two posts focused more on the visual side, and how it makes the game terrain look so much better.  In short, the tile transition logic overlays an additional sprite over adjacent tiles, so that where the two tiles meet has a much more natural look.    Left: Tile transitions on; Right: Tile transitions off.  So while the looks were taken care of, we also had to deal with the 'feel' of the tiles. The easiest example of this is the 1x1 landfill 'stepping stones'. It really looks like you should be able to walk/drive across the 1 tile of water. So we added in an additional layer of collision checks, which will consider the transitions when performing the logic of what can go where.    Now some of the cheesier among you will know that biters don't know how to get across these 1 tile gaps. That is because simply we never enabled the biters to use this collision check logic. One reason is that more checks means more UPS usage for the biter pathfinding, another is that we didn't think it was necessary. However it was available in the engine, and any mod could enable it if they want. That is exactly what I did with my Mining drones mod. Initially this seemed to work, and I thought it might make them walk around lakes a bit more naturally (like the player character does).  However quickly I noticed that people were reporting on the forum that the game was crashing with the mod installed. I quickly reverted the change to my mod and we started looking into it. It turns out that the new abstract pathfinder we added for better unit pathfinding (FFF-317) was not set up to consider units using this tile transition collision logic. This same crash was happening sometimes without any mods installed, but the case was more difficult to reproduce, so this is a nice situation where mods help us work on issues in the base game.  Recently I have been working on another unit heavy mod, Transport drones, and the principle design behind the mod heavily relies on the tile collision logic (the units don't even collide with entities). It turned out to be a really nice test of our new pathfinder, but also highlighted some of the issues that not considering the tile transitions can bring.  By not considering the tile transitions, the drone takes an awkward path along the diagonal road.  This week Oxyd finished his work on an upgrade to the pathfinder, so we can enable the tile transition collision logic with units. The change is immediately noticeable with the above example.  By considering the tile transitions, the drones path much more naturally.  With the logic now in place, we are debating whether to enable it for biters or not. We probably won't, it is only a minor change and would have a non-zero performance impact (a rough test puts the worst case at about 5%), but then again it is a fun way to surprise those who thought the 1 tile of water would stop the biters attacking, and it kinda makes sense they can walk over it just as the player can. Well we will see if there are any issues with it in the modded cases before any further consideration.  As a bonus fact (this is Factorio facts after all), I spent a bit of time benchmarking some late game Transport drone based factories (screenshot), and found a few nice performance gains.

Val has also been getting to grips with Lua, and this has led him to working on attenuations, which have been proving problematic. For instance, we noticed that sounds such as the radar were getting cut off when you walked away from them, rather than fading out cleanly.  I investigated and discovered we had a maximum environment sound limit of 15, by raising this to 50 we have eliminated many of these problems. But then the downside is that there are now more sounds playing and therefore more clutter to mix and balance.    Pink squares indicate which sounds are active.\r \r Left: limit of 15 nearby sounds; Right: limit of 50 nearby sounds.

More fun sounds include water splashes, electric and laser beams, more powerful weapons such as the gun turret and vehicle machine gun. And our old robot sounds have come back as additions.  If all goes to plan, we will merge the sound changes into master very soon, and once we've done all our pre-release checks, release it to the 0.18 experimental.  After that, I plan to spend time on UI sounds, and also balancing the overall levels to get them more in line with other games, which is trickier than normal given the lack of audio middleware.

{"page_num": "6", "name": "Friday Facts #338 - The (real) Character GUI", "body": "The Character GUI Twinsen  It was 11 months ago when we first mentioned the new Character GUI, in FFF-289. After all that time, it's finally getting ready. Since you can expect to see it released sometime in the next 1 or 2 weeks, we would like to present a quick recap of the features and changes, and some real in-game screenshots. ​ The Character window is now split into 3 tabs. Logisitcs and auto-trash were moved from the central frame into a tab and a new tab called Character was added. Using inventory/stack transfers in the player inventory will transfer the items either to weapons and armor slots or to trash slots depending on the selected tab, regardless of item type.    Logistics and auto trash are now merged into 1 panel. Using a double slider you can set an interval. If you have less than the first value, robots will bring more, if you have more than the second value, extra items will be auto-trashed and taken away by the robots. The double pop-up and extra confirm might seem strange, but it's made this way to solve the problem of robots bringing you items before you finished setting up your request.    With the merging of requests and auto-trash, we also made it so you can now set an unlimited number of requests, regardless of research. Furthermore, everything is unlocked in one research: unlimited logistic requests, auto trash, and 30 trash slots are all unlocked by the \"Logistic robotics\" research that is at blue science.  Searching now not only searches the recipe GUI, but also the inventory and logistic requests.    By popular demand, we also added a switch to quickly turn personal logics on or off. Turning off personal logistics will stop logistic robots from bringing requested items. It will also stop items from automatically being moved to the trash slots. Logistic robots will continue to empty the trash slots.    Since the recipe GUI has a new style, we also updated the look of the filter, item, circuit signal, and upgrade selection GUI styles. Some of the other GUIs in the game will have some visual issues due to the mix of old and new styles. My next step will be to fix these issues as soon as the Character GUI is released.  Looking back, this GUI took 13 months and 3 programmers (working alternatively) to implement. This is excluding mockups and UX design. It's a long story, but one thing that's obvious is that the GUI scope has grown far beyond what our codebase is capable of. For this reason, we won't be focusing obsessing that much on the GUI in the future. We will finalize the transition of styles, fix obvious issues and low hanging fruits, and try to get everything at a consistent level of quality for 1.0.  This new Character GUI and changes will likely affect some mods, especially those relying on logistic technologies, logistic slot related APIs, old style definitions, etc. Thankfully a lot of mods will be unaffected, so we hope it won't be too much disruption. Still, we wanted to give some forewarning.  ", "url": "/blog/post/fff-338", "img": "https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-338-thumb.png", "author": "Twinsen", "date": "2020-03-13"},
{"page_num": "6", "name": "Friday Facts #337 - Statistics GUI and Mod Debugger", "body": "Statistics GUI Klonan, Oxyd  The statistics GUI (electric network stats, production stats, etc.) is one of the GUIs that has been in the game for a very long time, and has had its functionality fleshed out reasonably over the years. It was not long ago when Twinsen added hovering and highlighting to the graphs.  Given that, and the relatively short timeframe for 1.0 release, the update of the statistics GUI has really just been a style update, no new features or heavy logic rewriting. Oxyd has most of the work done, so we are happy to show some real in-game screenshots of how it looks:    A notable change with the electric stats is that the Satisfaction/Production/Accumulator charge are next to each other in a single row, as opposed to each in a separate row. The label for the exact amount has also been moved to inside of the progress bar, which itself is much thicker.      The production stats are pretty much the same functionality wise. One new button you might spot is the search button.    However there are some problems with the search feature. As you can see, production and consumption frames have a different search box independent from each other. The main problem is when pressing CTRL+F to perform a regular search: How do we know which frame to open? Of course this could lead to different solutions like the use of a cycle for the focus of the search, in which the second time you press CTRL+F the other frame gets the focus. Or both of the search boxes open at the same time but only one gets the focus. Or only one frame gets the focus and the other one works only by pressing the button. But let's face it, these \"solutions\" are not solid at all and create inconsistency in the main design.  To solve this issue we decided that the simplest way to go is the use of just one search box on the header of the panel. This new location works as a general feature for the entire panel. One single search gives you 2 results, one on each frame. This solution is used in the new character window -to come soon- making it consistent with the whole design of the GUI.    You can also see we took this opportunity to integrate the Kill statistics in with the rest, instead of being its own window with its own hotkey.  The Statistics GUIs will need a few tweaks and polishings here and there before it is ready for release, but unless something unexpected happens you can expect it coming out in a release soon.

The offshore pump is practically a 1-tile entity, but they must have a 1 tile gap between each other. It is also the only entity placed on a water tile at the moment.  When we changed the way how terrain to water transitions work, we moved the offshore pump to be placed on the water tile. This can result in the pump drawing over terrain in ugly ways.      With the redesign, we took the oppourtunity to move the offshore back onto land, and additionally the pump checks a 2x3 tile water area in order to be buildable.      The new placement rules only applies to newly built pumps. Offshore pumps on existing maps will keep functioning, they’ll just be shifted out from the shore.  There is no blue colour for water integration at the tip of the offshore pump, so the offshore pump will look correct even with unexpected water types (not a big problem in vanilla). The water integration is split to an underwater layer which does not show when the pump gets landfilled over.      In the basic concept, the offshore pump is another type of a pump, so it should be similar to the other pump entity Albert made a few years ago, including the animation and visible fluid in it.  The obvious difference is the connection to water. However we felt that is not different enough and needs more visual balance, so we added a pair of supportive legs.    We are planning to release the new offshore pump graphics with the next release, likely next week.

{"page_num": "7", "name": "Friday Facts #330 - Main menu and File Share Shenanigans", "body": "The main menu rework Twinsen  Up until I looked at the source code, I was always confused about the differences between \"Start campaign\", \"New game\" and \"Scenarios\". New game seems like the same thing as \"Scenarios\"->\"Freeplay\", but are there any differences? We then later added a few more bonus scenarios, but they are hidden in the scenarios menu, with no explanation about what each is, what to expect or if it works in multiplayer. I believe it's very important to communicate to new players information about the game's content. It's also important to show that freeplay is the intended way to play. So all this prompted me to rework the main menu a bit.  I started with the structure. The structure always seemed odd to me, compared to what I'm used to from other games. Important options like \"Load game\" are lost among options that are never used (like \"Replay game\").\r \r So I came up with a new structure. It looks like this:\r  Continue Single player\r    New game Load game   Multiplayer\r    Host new game Host saved game Browse public games Browse LAN games Connect to address   Map Editor\r    New scenario Convert save   Settings\r    ...   Mods About  The first new thing to notice is the \"Continue\" button. Since \"start the game and continue my last save\" is probably the most common thing players will do, it makes sense that there is an option for this right at the top of the main menu. The button will contain the name of your latest save. Pressing it will immediately load the game and get you in game. Due to implementation complications, for now it only handles save games and it will NOT connect you to the last server you played on if your last play session was multiplayer, but I might implement that if it's highly requested.  Next, everything was grouped into either Single player or Multiplayer. There are much fewer options, since \"Replay game\" was moved as a small button in \"Load Game\", and every way to start playing the game was moved to the new \"New Game\" GUI.  The \"New game\" GUI shows all the ways to play the game. It also groups them nicely, places freeplay on top, shows a description and even a nice image. This GUI is used for new game, multiplayer hosting and map editor, thus simplifying the menu quite a bit.    For modders, scenarios can now contain a description.json file. In the file \"order\" determines the sorting in the New Game GUI; \"multiplayer-compatible\" determines whether the scenario is shown when trying to host multiplayer games. \"multiplayer-compatible\" was added to description.json file of campaigns also.

{"page_num": "8", "name": "Friday Facts #320 - Color correction ", "body": "Color correction Albert, V453000  Factorio is in a state that even though is not yet finished, it is very close to its 1.0 version. That means that most of the work is done and we are polishing the game in order to make it bright. That's what we've been doing for the past 2 weeks. Literally making it bright.  Since years I wanted to do this post-production work. But I didn't dare to do it until most of the graphics were finished. I was afraid of breaking the consistency of the look and our production pipeline. \r \r Now it's different. There's only a couple of entities to re-design and some other stuff to do, but in general this missing details are not affecting the possibility of working in the post-production.  Factorio is a dark game. I mean conceptually. All these things about industrializing a planet, polluting an entire world just for the sake of the factory, and killing all its inhabitants are not precisely happy concepts full of light. This old article could explain better my thoughts regarding this concept. But the look of the game was dark, too dark. So we cleaned it up without betraying its spirit. Like restoring an old painting.      The difference can be subtle, but very effective. We added more light, and a little bit of color saturation. Adding these general changes to the entire sprites collection is not an easy task. Many sprites were badly affected by this general correction. V453000 was fixing individually the broken sprites and icons in order to keep the consistency with the new context.  We took the chance to work on the terrain a bit further. Not only this color correction was applied, but the contrast and integration with other terrains was also improved. Also experimenting with the color of the trees, trying to achieve a more colorful feeling with the excuse of an alien planet. I have to say the Alien Biomes mod was opening my mind - a little - to experiment with the color a bit further.      In order to break this general brown feeling, we added a more orange tonality to the sand biome. Here is where you can see the difference more. Going further to too saturated colors is dangerous, after all, the terrain is a background that should provide a good and comfortable contrast with the entities and the icons.      Touching terrain colours means touching map colors also. We were very keen to keep the visibility of the map information and the similarity with the terrain. The result is a more vibrant look in the entire game.      We tweaked the night also. Thanks to posila and Wheybags, we can use LUTs (Look up tables) to dynamically modify the colors. Instead of playing with the alpha channel of a solid black layer on top of the game. Now we can gradually move to a different color palette for night with more control. So the colors are losing their saturation and becoming more blue and cold. This is important, because part of the annoying darkness of the game comes from this black layer.      We are still experimenting with this LUT, and the transitions of day/night cycles. I'm pretty sure also that I will have to touch the map colors for some missing details and fine tuning. Possibly there is some entity that is not in its best shape with these new color palettes, and maybe we keep tweaking the terrain. But I feel very confident with these additions and I'm very sure that these changes will improve the experience of playing Factorio. After playing with these colors, the feeling is good. I hope you see it the same way.  ", "url": "/blog/post/fff-320", "img": "https://cdn.factorio.com/assets/img/blog/fff-320-thumb.png", "author": "Albert", "date": "2019-11-08"},

We've been pushing ahead a lot with both the scripting and blocking out the physical level design.\r One of the problems we've come up against a lot, is that we often need to perform custom edits to the map, which are quite tedious, but not common enough to add a new tool to the map editor for them. For example, something like \"disable all the spawners in this region\".  This kind of problem is easily solved with a little bit of custom Lua code, but getting the specification of the area we want to edit into Lua is a painful process of noting down and typing out location coordinates. It is also easy to lose track of these Lua snippets, as there is no good place to save them.  To solve this problem, we decided to add a Lua snippet tool to the map editor. This tool will let you drag your cursor over an area, and it will then run your custom Lua code on that area. The snippets are named, and saved in your player-data.json, so you can keep them around for later.  For example, this simple snippet replaces trees with biters.  Currently, there doesn't seem to be a very big scene for community made custom maps/scenarios with custom maps, and we're hoping that the example from the campaign once released, as well as the much improved editor we have in 0.17 will encourage more people to give this a go.

The two lucky CPUs were a i9-9980XE 18-core and a Ryzen 3900X 12-core.    We are using the time to complete our test suite in 'heavy mode' as a benchmark. Heavy mode basically saves and reloads the game each tick, and compares a CRC of the map from before and after. It is super slow to run, but the heavy test is critical to help find any possible determinism issues. There is some more info on 'heavy mode' in FFF-63.  As a baseline, the 'standard' CPU in the office for developers is the i9-7900x 10-core, which runs heavy tests in about 530 seconds. In real time this is 8 minutes and 50 seconds, a long time for a team member to sit around for results before they can push. We can do better!  As you would expect, the new 18-core was blazing fast, with a test time of about 400 seconds, shaving off over 2 minutes. However the Ryzen was a different story, with a test time of about 600 seconds. This goes against what we predicted, where more cores and higher frequency mean lower test times. The initial results from the 12-core Ryzen were worse than from the 10-core Intel; not a good start.  So I did some digging and some research, and the answer I arrived at was RAM. When we ordered the parts, not much thought was given to the selection of RAM, just some standard 16GB 2666MHz sticks to fill all the slots. Luckily, I looked on a local Czech website, and they had some stock of the brand new G.SKILL 3600MHz Trident RGB Neo, a high performance RAM stick made exactly to suit our new Ryzen CPU. After installing the new RAM, we had a test result that better matched our expectations: 450 seconds. We knew beforehand that Ryzen liked fast RAM, but we didn't realize how significant of a difference it could make.  So now we have set up both these new machines to run tests automatically after each commit, and we are very happy with the result. The new i9-9980XE can compile and run heavy tests faster than our old i7-4790K can compile and run just normal tests. Having it run automatically also frees up individual developers from the responsibility of running heavy tests locally, so they can just push as normal and continue working.

{"page_num": "9", "name": "Friday Facts #312 - Fluid mixing saga & Landfill terrain", "body": "Fluid mixing saga Dominik  Hello Factorians,  Today I would like to talk to you about my favourite subject - fluid mixing and its prevention. It is a new mechanic introduced in 0.17 that seemed quite simple at first, but has been giving me nightmares ever since.  A while ago I took on the task of updating the fluid system (FFF-260). The way it works in 0.16 is that the fluid boxes (the thing that holds the fluid and is contained in entities like pipes or refineries) had no organisation whatsoever except their connections. They would sit there and do nothing and then once per update send fluid somewhere. It had it's issues especially with symmetry, and when you happened to put some fluid where it did not belong, you could end up requiring major demolition works.  My task was to develop a better algorithm to move the fluids, and a very very optional side task I had in mind was to do something about the fluids getting to wrong places and mixing. We started by organizing the fluid boxes into systems (connected FBs make a system) managed by a special fluid manager, and optimizing the heck out of it (FFF-271).  Soon after, I started working on the new algorithm and anti fluid-mixing. Until then nobody really considered preventing the fluid mixing seriously as it did not seem possible. But when I thought about it, it did not seem that hard. The idea is to simply not allow any action that would lead to fluids getting where they are not supposed to go. When you build a steam pipeline, you should not need nor want it to touch another fluid.  In principle, it would only require a few quite realistic mechanisms:\r  A connected block of fluid boxes would either be fluid-free, or it would be locked to one fluid.\r Two such blocks can connect only if they are compatible - either one has no fluid lock, or they have the same fluid.\r An assembler can only set a recipe if it is compatible with the fluid locks on its fluid boxes.\r Have a migration from old saves that can contain mixing.\r \r By creating the fluid systems right before, number 1 was almost finished and we only needed to assign the lock. It would be set either by a fluid, or by a 'filter', which is a fluidbox that is set to use a fluid - such as a water pump using water, or assembler having some inputs/outputs given by a recipe.  After a while I had both the fluid algorithm and the mixing done (FFF-274). The mixing was not that easy (like 5x more complicated) but it worked pretty well. As for the fluid algorithm, V453000 and Twinsen found some issues with waves on a macro scale, and because it was right before releasing  the 0.17 experimental, we decided to hold it off on it for the time being (we have a new version now that seems okay, but has to wait for 0.17 becoming stable first). The mixing made it through though and seemed quite finished.  It turned out that the work on it was at most one tenth complete.    Some difficulties appeared already before the initial release, but that was only a hint of what would come later. One by one, then ten by ten, bugs started coming. The problem is that as often as not, they were not just little issues with simple fixes. Instead, over and over, they turned the current solution on its head and the code had to be completely rewritten in order to account for the new case. As of now, almost exactly half a year and many rewrites later, it is still not fully bug free.  The number one issue was with Assembling machines. It turned out that their code was pretty messy and does not simply allow the checks I needed, so it had to be refactored. The next problem was that the check was not only required when setting a recipe on an existing assembler - as I naively thought - but in about one million different situations I would not dream existed. Building a fixed recipe assembler. Reviving an assembler. Rotating. Blueprint of an assembler. Blueprint with a recipe and a rotation placed over a ghost with a non-default rotation during a full moon. Teleport. Script building. Copy-paste settings. Any combination of these.  Pretty much every case would go through different paths in the code and behave entirely differently. Fixing one would break another and so tons of tests had to be written. When these cases finally worked, it turned out that doing these operations when they fail (e.g. can’t rotate because it would cause mixing) brings another wave of issues. And then mods come and the complexity multiplies. All this, although in a more simple form, had to be done for all other entities that can use fluid too, such as inserters (mods...).  Another number one issue are underground connections. When playing, you would not think twice about them but on a closer look they are all but simple. They have this (cough) uncomfortable feature (want to shoot myself) that you can build another underground pipe between them (or take it out) and a complex reconnection logic jumps in. It means that based on building order, connections are established and reestablished differently. This is a big thing when building a blueprint with many pipes, or loading a save game.  But the largest issue is one tiny corner case with huge implications. Have two underground pipes that have different fluids, but are split by a third, and it gets removed. Until now mixing was theoretically completely avoidable, but here it was and there was nothing to stop it.    As a result, a new concept is introduced - a blocked connection. An underground connection that would normally connect but can’t. Establishing it is the easier part. But when does it get fixed? An entity miles away gets rotated, that splits a fluid system, disconnecting the blocked connection from a fluid filter on the other side, and the connection should unblock. But even something as simple as a rotation contains fluid fixes and re-establishing of fluid boxes and if it fails, it still fixes the blocked connection in the process and it can’t be undone... You get the picture. And we are still talking about underground pipes, while anything can have underground connections, including said assemblers, which the previous code did not consider at all. The complexity just goes deeper and deeper, and Rseding is probably right that we should have never gone this way at all.  So the bug fixing has been basically running in circles - clearing one batch of bugs, thinking that those were the last ones and the ordeal is finally over, only to find another batch (ideally from some bizzare modder idea) a few days later. Many times I wished that mods never existed. Nor multiplayer, or any players at all for that matter. \r About two months ago all seemed really fine, with basically no reports and just a few crashes in the automated crash reports.  At that moment another nightmare materialized in the form of a talented volunteer bug tester named boskid, who took on a personal crusade to break the fluids to dust (I actually imagine him sitting in his dark room with evil laughter, dreaming about making my next day worse than the previous). In all seriousness, he has done a great deal of work with his bug testing, creating bizzare modded cases and testing scripts, and deserves a big thanks. He is actually coming to our offices next week, so follow the news for reports of developers falling out of windows.  An example of a nice configuration he found (and I can’t fix).  The whole time we were taking the offensive approach to mixing - crash the game when it happens - so that we know about bugs to fix them. Recently we have decided to put a stop to it and have the mixing automatically fix itself once it is detected, eyeing the end of this episode. Right now I have 3 mixing bugs on the list and I am sure those are the last, and mixing will be done (lying to myself is a way to cope with it) and the new fluid algorithm can come soon after :).

This means that with almost every change we argue and discuss a lot before making a final decision. Sometimes we argue about everything, from the smallest GUI change, to how a major feature should work. This is probably not a bad thing since this means changes are usually well thought out and unpopular ideas or changes don't make it to the game very often. Some people feel quite strongly about their opinions or sometimes the team is very divided on what should we do. Today we'll share some of those opinions and controversies.

{"page_num": "10", "name": "Friday Facts #305 - The Oil Changes", "body": "Lua Mod GUI additions Rseding  Mod GUIs have been an interesting part of Factorio modding since I started working at Wube. They allow scenarios and mods to add GUIs that look and feel like the base game.    When someone new to Factorio modding is introduced to how they function, they almost always have the same questions:\r  Why is mod GUI part of the game state?\r Why do mod GUIs need to be deterministic?\r How can I edit the base game GUIs?  And then comes the explanation:\r \r The actual widgets are not part of the game state and are not deterministic. The part that mods have access to however is. In an environment where mods have to operate deterministically, if a mod is allowed to read some data that data must be deterministic. In that simple bit of logic; if a mod can read the checked state of a checkbox then that checked state needs to be deterministic. If the mod didn't have access to read that state it would need to store the last-known state and update it every time it got the changed event.  Try to imagine that: every single mod implementing their own system for remembering last-known-state about GUIs they're using. Instead of leaving that entire mess to mod developers we decided long ago that we would manage that \"last-known-state\" for them. The basic data about what a given mod wanted to show on screen is recorded so mods can read and change it as they want and not need to be concerned with constantly updating it every time some changed event happens. Additionally it means that the game can use that \"last known state\" to restore what the player sees if they save, quit, and load the game.  That still leaves the last question: \"How can I edit the base game GUIs?\". Using the above example it's much easier to explain that: as a mod - you can't. The base game GUIs are not implemented using this same system - they're just pure collections of widgets. None of the \"last known state\" is saved anywhere and it's all lost when saving, quitting, and loading.  However, that leaves a divide: we need to implement each widget type through the \"CustomGui\" system in order for mods to be able to use them. With this latest release I finally figured out a way to do tabbed panes since they're special in how they work compared to everything else. Additionally I figured out a semi-friendly way for mods to put things directly on the screen in a way that the player can drag them around - instead of being limited to some fixed area (left, top, center, etc).  Another system which I've been thinking about for quite some time is some way for mods to position GUI elements relative to base game GUIs. For example: a mod wants to add a pane which shows on the left of the character inventory GUI. Currently it's not possible - the base game GUI isn't readable by mods so they can't do anything with it. My idea is some system where a mod can say \"I want to add this GUI, and I want it to be shown relative to the character GUI on the left side\" and then any time the character GUI is shown it would also show the mod GUI.  There are some critical parts to this new system. It needs to:\r  Be easy to expand (either automatically works with all new base game GUIs or works with minimal effort).\r Not break with simple refactoring.\r Not cause other programmers trouble by existing.\r Not prevent base game GUIs from working how they need to work.\r \r So far none of it seems impossible. I don't know when I'll have it working, but I'm looking forward to what mods will do with it.

I don't think in the history of Factorio the bug forum has been so clean. No doubt once we mark 0.17 as stable the count will shoot up again.  For this weeks graph I added the count of players on Steam as the left axis. We thought it would be somewhat interesting to see if there is any correlation between the two.  Note: The axis have different scales.  I also prepared the same graph but for the duration of the 0.17 release. You can see our player numbers are dropping quite a lot, from the all time peak of 22,457 on the 3rd of March 2019.    While bug reports might be at an all time low, we are not going to call the game stable yet. We still have an important milestone to reach, that is, implementing the new Introduction campaign graphics (FFF-301). A lot of the team has been on vacation these last few weeks, including the whole campaign team and most of the art department. What this means is that we expect it will be a few more weeks before we can call the current version stable.  We have been asked a few times when stable will be released, but my question is, why does it matter exactly which version we call stable? Are you waiting for stable to play a new playthrough? The thing is, this stable is only going to be the 'first' stable. Our plan is to have a number of short experimental phases after the first stable, where we will add new GUI's and such, which will add bugs and technical debt. After fixing the bugs in a 'small' experimental content release, we will then mark that as the 'new' 0.17 stable.

{"page_num": "10", "name": "Friday Facts #302 - The multiplayer megapacket", "body": "The multiplayer megapacket Twinsen  Last month I joined KatherineOfSky's MMO event as a player. I noticed that after we reached a certain number of players, every few minutes a bunch of them got dropped. Luckily for you (but unluckily for me), I was one of the players who got disconnected every, single. time, even though I had a decent connection. So I took the matter personally and started looking into the problem. After 3 weeks of debugging, testing and fixing, the issue is finally fixed, but the journey there was not that easy.  Multiplayer issues are very hard to track down. Usually they only happen under very specific network conditions, in very specific game conditions (in this case having more than 200 players). Even when you can reproduce the issue it's impossible to properly debug, since placing a breakpoint stops the game, messes up the timers and usually times out the connection. But through some perseverance and thanks to an awesome tool called clumsy, I managed to figure out what was happening.  The short version is: Because of a bug and an incomplete implementation of the latency state simulation, a client would sometimes end up in a situation where it would send a network package of about 400 entity selection input actions in one tick (what we called 'the megapacket'). The server then not only has to correctly receive those input actions but also send them to everyone else. That quickly becomes a problem when you have 200 clients. It quickly saturates the server upload, causes packet loss and causes a cascade of re-requested packets. Delayed input actions then cause more clients to send megapackets, cascading even further. The lucky clients manage to recover, the others end up being dropped.  The issue was quite fundamental and took 2 weeks to fix. It's quite technical so I'll explain in juicy technical details below. But what you need to know is that since Version 0.17.54 released yesterday, multiplayer will be more stable and latency hiding will be much less glitchy (less rubber banding and teleporting) when experiencing temporary connection problems. I also changed how latency hiding is handled in combat, hopefully making it look a bit smoother.

{"page_num": "10", "name": "Friday Facts #301 - Crash site: First state", "body": "Crash site: First state Ernestas, V453000, Albert  For many weeks now the GFX department has been focused on preparing replacements for the placeholder graphics of the campaign crash site. The subject as usual is not that easy because we had to first solve the main concept of the crash site.  It happens that those new entities belong to the Factorio universe, but they come from a different reality than the usual DIY/diesel punk of the game. So we had to invent a new way to design machines that look like Factorio but that are not too familiar.  Here a proof of concept of the look:    The concept is that the big (medium) spaceship broke into pieces as it crash landed, and lost many components that the player, during the introduction, will repair and use for his own profit.  The look of the spaceship remnants are a little bit based on the designs of the 60’s/70’s pulp Sci-Fi. Fortunately we can keep the look of Factorio due the accident, which allows us to destroy and dirty up the machines show many inner mechanical details.  It is also part of the concept that all the machines that the player builds, are based on an existing technology from his home planet. So the machines that we see in the regular game are like 'cheap' versions of the original ones.    For the lab, we keep the dome shape and the beams inside in order to keep consistency with the regular laboratory. So slowly the player gets used to the meaning of the shapes.    The generator is similar to a substation -more or less-, connectable like a pole but it also produces electricity. Sometimes we really have to invent.    This works like an assembling machine. The design is more based in the (yet unshown) redesign of the assembling machines, rather than on the actual 'classic' ones.    These cylinders are like chests. We decided to make them cylindrical instead of a box for this difference in technology level that we are speaking about. The player will recognize them for the shape, color, and they also always have a number printed. You don’t really want to know the meaning of the numbers.  All this new content is a work in progress, and we made these new entities first for the testing of the campaign. Based on feedback with testers we will have the chance to tweak and adapt whatever is necessary. In the case of the introduction, the positioning of the entities can have a large impact on the flow of the gameplay. Once we are more sure of the final placement, we can see how all the pieces will fit together.  The next round for the crash site is the main crashed spaceship, and some other assets that converts the scene into a full composition, more proper for the introduction of the game.

We are celebrating that we managed to write something about the game development of Factorio every single Friday and reached the number 300. Since we hopefully won't get to another round number like this before finishing the game, we would like to make this one a little bit different. We will introduce people from the team.  Everyone was asked to answer the following questions:\r  What were your favorite video games growing up? What did you do before Factorio? What do you do in the Team? What's your favorite part of Factorio? Anything else that is important about you. \r Here are the answers:   Michal (kovarex) Kovařík  Founder, Game designer, Developer, \"Approver\"  My favorite games are: Baldur's gate, Starcraft, Civilisation, Xcom, They are billions, Homam III, Half life 2, Fallout 1/2, Supaplex, Baba is you.  I encountered programming when I was 11 and I was instantly hooked for life. I knew that I would do programming job since then. I loved to program things where the result might produce something that couldn't be expected before running it. I tried to do simplistic animal simulation with DNA evolution, GO problem solver, a math equation solver or bwapi - a C++ API for Starcraft . I studied at a university in Prague, but never finished as I started to work as a programmer instead. After 4.5 years, the urge to work on my own terms and make games pushed me to start the Factorio project.  I like to say that Factorio was my first game, but it actually isn't true. We had a very interesting rule in our school. Games weren't allowed unless it was programmed by someone from the school. It gave us a great motivation to create, and several people made content for the rest of the school. I tried to do a text based RPG, Civ like game, Starcraft like game, none of these got to be fully playable games, since I was young and didn't have the patience or understanding of how much work is needed to do these kind of games. But I've certainly learned a lot on the way and it also gave me the will to finish Factorio as I want to finish something for once.  In games, I'm most focused on progression, exploration of the game mechanics, optimizing them to become overpowered, and solving things in a way that is somewhat specific to me. My favorite parts of Factorio are tied to progression, when new tech allows me to progress faster (construction robots, personal transportation) or when old improvised parts of the factory are replaced by specialized and better organized high-production facilities and the products start to flow in much higher numbers.  Factorio is being made for 7 years. I had to do basically everything in the start, but these days, my role is mainly something I would call an \"approver\". I'm trying to make sure, that only additions/changes that are good enough are pushed to the game. Here comes the \"kovarex approved\". I don't always feel comfortable in the role of rejecting many things or nitpicking about results of other peoples work, but someone needs to do it... Apart from that, I'm doing a little bit of a project management and trying to answer when people ask about code that I wrote or touched. The rest of the time (which is still the majority, thankfully) I do programming.  Factorio is being made for such a long time, that I managed to get married and have three kids in the meantime. My interests outside the computer world are mainly paragliding, board games, Lego, RC toys, GO, and playing the piano.   Tomáš (slpwnd) Kozelek  Managing Director  My favorite games are Age of Empires 2, Civilization, Warcraft 2, Operation FlashpointQ  Before Factorio I studied Informatics at the Charles University in Prague. During and after studies I went through various freelance jobs and ended up in market making company in Amsterdam for couple of years.  I joined Kovarex very early on as a core developer working on basics of many areas of the game. Working on a new project from scratch and being involved in the software architecture from the beginning was exactly what I was after at that time and I enjoyed it a lot. In the early days we also had to take care of the full scope of game development ourselves - development itself, testing, web, crowdfunding, community and support, etc.  As the company grew I moved to more executive position doing less coding and more organising the work of other people. About three years ago I started to recede from the active position in the company and currently I help with administration, business and important decisions regarding the direction of Factorio and the company.  For me, my favorite part about Factorio has always been the mini-game of trying to fit the production lines into limited, usually uneven area. So in this light I was into the scenario game Tight Spot quite a lot. And obviously going around existing factory and enjoying the view of all the organised movement on the screen. That was what really caught my attention back when Kovarex showed me one of very first prototypes of the game.   Albert (glex) Bertolín Soler  Art Director  When I was a kid I was mesmerized with the graphics of the videogames. To me the fact of controlling a character in the TV was just magic. I played games in order to see the graphics of the next level, whatever game is. I was in the arcades without a coin watching the pros playing games for the joy of the graphics.  I started my career destroying my hand playing with the old Atari 2600 , Pacman, Pitfall, Space Invaders. I got blind playing anything in my beloved MSX 8bit computer with special love to Batman and Head over Heels, Penguin adventure, La abadia del Crimen,  Nemesis, R-type. I peeled my thumbs with the buttons of the NES playing Super Mario bros 1 and 3, Blades of Steel,  Skate or die, Double bubble and many others. When the PC came to my place, my wrist bones were slowly getting out of place due the use of the mouse playing Maniac Mansion, Dune 2000, Syndicate, Alone in the dark, Quake, Doom (chiquito wad), Carmaggedon, Half life, Flashback to say some. To me one of the best games ever is ICO for the PS2  Before getting to Factorio I was in the studio Glaznost, creating experimental audiovisuals in real-time with “gLanzoL”, our own mod of Counter Strike -When it was a mod of Half Life- We played in clubs and festivals all around Europe and a bit beyond. \r Composed electronic music for concerts, experimented a lot with interactives and videogames, making commercial and experimental projects for lots of clients.\r We also made lots of exhibitions with my artwork in galleries and published illustrations for several editorials.  Now in Wube I'm in charge of the art department, responsible of the aesthetics of Factorio, designing sprites, conceptualizing, 3d modeling, animating, coordinating artists, balancing look, style and usability. Designing GUI, making icons, graphic design and drinking lots of coffees.   Asaftei (Twinsen) Robert  Programming, Game Design, UX, Project Management\r   http://twinsen.info/  Quite your typical nerd. I graduated Computer Science in Romania back in 2013. After graduating there was no shortage of job opportunities, so being a gamer I chose to start working in a small company making video games in Unity. There I worked on many small games. During that time, I not only took game programming seriously but also game design, learning quite a bit on the subject, from Gamasutra articles to dev blogs, to GDC talks to even taking an online university course in Gamification.\r I would talk about video games at work, often mentioning games like OpenTTD. So one of my co-workers mentioned I should check out this Early-Access game called Factorio. So I went home and downloaded the demo for what was probably version 0.10. This was at 10pm so I thinking I'll play the demo and then go to sleep. As you would guess I got the demo, then immediately got the full game which I ended up playing until 5am. So I started reading Friday Facts. In one of the posts they mentioned how they are hiring. Even though I had never used C++ outside university and never touched lua, I decided to re-learn C++ over the course of a week and then applied for the job. Some interviews and test weeks later, I moved to Prague to work on Factorio and I have been doing that for the past 4 years.  My most notable contribution to the game was the Circuit Network, for which I'm the main designer and coder. Apart from that, I worked on many other small things, from the trailers, to UI, to Project Management to help organize the team.  Outside of Factorio I do everything you would expect a nerdy guy to do: 3D printing, I fly quadcopters and even build my own racing drones, I film and edit drone videos. My latest project is a 5kW electric mountain board. I also manufactured my own skateboard remote by doing everything from PCB etching to soldering to 3D printing.  Electronics is one hobby but of course the other one is video games. I play quite a lot of them actually, across all platforms. I also like to hang around gamers, so you will find me at Gamescom almost every year.  These days I'm going outside of my bubble and socializing in hopes of finding that special someone. So if you know someone, send her my way ;)  That's all for now, I'm back to fixing a serious multiplayer issue (what we call \"the megapacket\"). Something I'll no doubt write about in a future FFF once I figure everything out.   Michal (posila) Pavelčík  Developer  The first video game I was obsessed with was Sonic The Hedgehog on Sega Master System II. Later on PC, I liked 90's strategy games, city builders and tycoons, and Czech point & click adventure games.  I started to learn programming because I wanted to make my own games. Unfortunately, first I learned Pascal and Delphi and was stubbornly trying to prove to the world games don't need to be made in C or C++. These attempts ended up with me making an editor or framework to make a game with, and never actually making any game (besides some mini-games that we played on computers in my school's library with class mates). Later I switched to C# and when I went to university, I got very excited about functional programming paradigm. However, gradually I started to be interested in high performance computing and my interests circled back to programming in C++ and partially even assembly.  When I couldn't bring myself to finish my degree in computer science and decided to leave university, I felt like I'm not good enough to work on big games, so instead I took a job in a company building business applications. The first time I heard of Factorio was from a coworker who said her friends were making a factory building game and launching an IndieGoGo campaign. I couldn't tell what is going on in the campaign trailer and didn't participate.  After some time I regained a confidence in my professional capabilities and started thinking about switching to video game industry. The coworker mentioned Factorio again, and at around that time a friend from university told me Factorio is hiring. I downloaded the demo (0.10 at the time), but played it only for about 10 minutes. Instead I sent my CV to a new big studio working on a AAA game in Prague. They didn't respond.  I figured I became too confident without anything to show for it, so I quit my job with a plan to make a jaw dropping graphical demo that I could attach to my CV. I became Rank 68 Monk in Greater Rift Seasonal Hardcore leaderboards.  I started to play Factorio again (0.11 this time), and progressed through campaign a started to like the game. It was much more than top-down Minecraft what I thought it was when I played it the first time. In the end things worked out very well for me and I am happy kovarex and Tomáš allowed me to join the team.  When playing Factorio I like the progression, where from nothing I built a huge factory (of spaghetti design preferably) and if something doesn't work I can blame only myself. I don't like when other humans mess with my stuff, though.   Ondřej (Oxyd) Majerech  Developer  I've been unreasonably drawn toward computers since I was a kid. At first I'd\r spend most of my time playing games, like Dune 2, Supaplex or F-19 Stealth\r Fighter. I still have a thing for simulation and puzzle style games.  Soon after, I discovered programming, and it was perhaps even more fun than\r video games. I tried making my own simulation-style game back then when I was\r around 13 or so, which obviously didn't work out too well, but I kept dreaming\r about being able to make a game one day.  I discovered Factorio whilst still working toward my computer science master's\r degree. Sinking time into the game didn't exactly help my education, but then I\r noticed there was a programming position open, and it was right here in Prague!\r Applying was the natural choice.  Over the years with the team I got to work on some interesting problems. I've\r spent a lot of my time working on the biter AI, multiplayer and networking code,\r and I wrote the code for rendering the technology tree. I'm also one of the\r Linux developers on the team, so I take care of Linux-specific issues with the\r game.  When playing RTS games, I'd always spend way too much time working on my base,\r and not focus enough on doing much actual battling. When playing Factorio for\r the first time, I was really excited when I realised that focusing on my 'base'\r was exactly what I was supposed to do. That's what really drew me toward the\r game in the beginning.   Robert (Rseding) Eding  Developer  I first saw Factorio when one of the people I watched on Twitch was streaming it. The guy was using several mods and was talking about how one the mods was having performance problems. I ended up buying the game just so I could try to fix the performance problem with the mods he was using and in the process found the game was a lot of fun. A short time after that (and several minor mods aimed at improving performance) I heard from the other modders that Wube let some of the more active mod developers have read access to the source code. That sounded like a lot of fun to try an implement the performance fixes in the core game so I sent Kovarex a message on the forums. A few messages later (and I assume Kovarex's shared love for optimizations) I was in. After quickly learning my way around the code (and in the process starting to learn about C++) I was submitting pull requests for things and was eventually offered a job.  The power to do (almost) exactly what I want through C++ is amazing. Every time I need to use other languages I find them lacking and it brings be back to wanting what C++ offers. Every time I play other games and experience the inevitable performance problems they have my mind goes over just what they might have done wrong, or what the language they're using is doing wrong that's causing the performance problems. At some level it has reduced how much I can enjoy other games because I want to go fix their problems. However, it also gives me a better appreciation when I find a game that \"does it right\". I've even tried to contact some other indie-style games to see if they would let me attempt performance improvements on their games, but so far I have only had luck with Factorio.  4 years and 304 days after Kovarex gave me a chance to prove myself I still love working on optimizations. It's what got me into working on Factorio, it's what I love doing, and it benefits the game by improving the experience for those that play it. When someone asks what I do for fun I get to tell them that what I do for fun is what I do for work: both are the same thing and I get paid to do what I love. I can't think of a better job than that.   Vaclav (V453000) Benc  Technical artist (and a bit of game design)  Played a lot of games since childhood, the most memorable one being Transport Tycoon. In the more recent years I enjoyed Age of Empires 2 HD, Borderlands 2, DOOM (2016), They Are Billions or the iPad version of Rollercoaster Tycoon.  I discovered OpenTTD around 2007, spent a lot of time in a community of crazy people. Eventually I started creating mods for it which really hooked me into creating game graphics and basic coding.  OpenTTD friends got me into Factorio. I discovered that it’s exactly the type of game I would enjoy, that the graphics are created in a very similar same way as I was trying to do for OpenTTD, and also that the development is happening only 100km away from me. It was clear what I needed to do.  As an artist I enjoy automating as much of the pipeline as possible. I love writing Python scripts so I like it best when I have a task that can utilize it a lot, like tilesets (rails, transport belts, resources) or things with many outputs like the player character animations, or combinators with all their offsets for circuit wire connections. Usually the outputs of my work come from Albert’s models, like most of the entities converted into high resolution.  I also play Factorio a lot and I contribute to gameplay/balancing discussions and the design of the new campaign and introduction. I’m especially happy with the introduction of Space science packs in 0.15, the science pack and technology changes for 0.17 and the worm/spitter attacks added in 0.17.   Scott (Klonan) Woodhouse  Press, Community, and Support manager  When I was a young lad, I spent a lot of time playing Age of Empires 1 and 2, mostly in the scenario editor, trying to build the biggest and most defended base possible. I also fondly remember playing Red alert 1 on my Playstation 1, just spending hours building turrets and impenetrable bases.  After studying Economics at university, I got a job doing Stock management for a large British department store. During this time, I discovered Factorio from watching a Youtube video from Zisteau. I was instantly hooked. I became involved in writing some mods and scenarios, discussing the game on the forum and the Subreddit. When a position for a Community manager opened at the end of 2015, I applied for the job, and that’s how I ended up here.  When I joined the team at the start of 2016, all my focus was on the preparation for the Steam launch in February. I was responsible for setting up the Steam store page, distributing review keys, as well as handling all the support emails. Over time I have assumed a lot of other non-development work, most notably producing the weekly FFF post. If you send an email to the team, I will be your first point of contact.  My favorite part of Factorio can be divided in 2. As a player, I really enjoy the base building part of the game, especially as in Factorio, it has a ‘purpose’. Having a massive industrial machine with walls as thick as mountains brings a certain joy to my heart. I also do a lot of modding, and the Factorio modding system is really nice to work with, so that is my second favorite part of the game.   Jitka Řihova  Office Manager  My favorite games growing up were all those 90's DOS games on floppy discs! This question brought me back, hard to pick one, so there is a list: Prince of Persia, Prehistoric, Winter and Summer challenge... and the multiplayer ones like Bubble Bubble and Tunneler! Later Civilization I. and Transport Tycoon. Oh, and Supaplex! The obsession with this game came back when I discovered there is a mobile version — still loving it.  Whats my place in the team? Heh, taking care of quite a broad range of stuff really... Let's say I am the Team mummy, does that make sense? That's probably the best description I can think of.  My favorite thing about Factorio is the team behind it. So many great people, so many different personalities! And the biters, of course. I still consider them being cute :wink:  Outside of work I spend my time traveling and being out in nature in general. Shame the world is too big to cover everything in a single lifetime. Spending time abroad (mostly backpacking) makes me understand the world better.   Ernestas Norvaišas  3D Generalist  Growing up I had many favorite games, but the best of them would be Stronghold Crusader, Age of Empires, Cossacks, American Conquest, Red Alert 2, C&C Generals. Mainly I was interested in creating my own scenarios and simulating stories, but crushing bots was fun too!  Before working at Factorio I was studying at a maritime academy to be an engineer. After 3 years I decided it was not for me, so I dropped out with high hopes to turn my hobby into work, and a nice cheque for the academy to return some of the money they invested in me. Or how I saw it, as motivation to find a job faster. Not long after playing some Factorio I wrote to the team, and ended up working and learning with amazing people.  From the beginning, I was mainly responsible for all of the environment, decorations, and background for the game. If by any chance you have seen an enemy, maybe some tile with decoratives, or a tree, then you probably saw what I work on. But my work is not limited to that, I also work on entities, and applications to (for example) prototype new ideas.  Before working at Wube my favorite part of the game was adventure. Exploring, finding new resource patches, finding a better or more compact way to build something. But after understanding mechanics, seeing countless Reddit posts of various bases and seeing Vaclav create and explain these beautiful monstrosities, the adventure was lost, because almost everything was known. So now the favorite part is seeing reactions from people on projects I work on, for example, the reaction to cliffs, how cute and cuddly the biters are, etc.   Tom (wheybags) Mason  Developer  My favourite games from my childhood are probably the original Spyro trilogy (especially 3), and later RPGs like Fable and Oblivion.  The Elder Scrolls series has been a major influence for me, the first hint of \"I want to make games\" was a vague idea that it would have been amazing to be on the Oblivion team working on miscellaneous quests.  Before moving to Prague to work with Wube on Factorio, I lived in my native Dublin, Ireland, and worked for a company making tools for texture authoring in video games. I also contributed to some open source projects like OpenMW, and ran my own, freeablo, an ongoing open source re-implementation of the Diablo 1 game engine. I studied Computer Science in Trinity College Dublin, but I still feel that it was my work on OpenMW that really taught me how to program in the real world. It was only there that I learned how to read and understand other people's code, how to use Git, and write C++. This was compounded afterwards by professional work and my own open source projects, but I still consider it the original core of my experience.  I've been at Wube since August 2017, and I'm currently working on the campaigns, both the Introduction and the main campaign. The \"campaign team\" is quite inter-disciplinary, with three main contributors; one each from programming, level design and art. I mostly work on programming, so whenever we need a new engine feature implemented for the campaign, it usually falls to me. We do blur the lines quite a lot though, so I end up working a lot on design and level scripting too. I think this mix of tech and design suits me quite well, which is surprising to me as I had always focused on a pure technical position before. I'm also responsible for a collection of other small bits around the codebase, like the deploy process for releasing new versions of the game, and the text renderer/rich text engine.  My favourite part about Factorio is probably the ability the game has to induce a state of flow. People often joke about how they sit down to play for an hour or two in the evening, and suddenly it's 2am, and I think the main reason for this is how easy it is to slip into a flow state when you're playing. It is quite like programming in this way, except much easier to get into and maintain your flow, because, after all, it is optimised for fun.   Dominik Met Franek  Developer  The first game I ever played was Commander Keen 4, it was on my grandmothers beefed up PC which was rare at the time, as it was shortly after the fall of communism, but she worked at the technical university. The \"golden age\" was high school with a lot of Starcraft and insane Doom 2 tournaments, where I was already learning from Kovarex. But the games that really grew to my heart were Might and Magic 6 and Baldur's gate 1.  I like to be versatile so I was jumping between place to get experience. I got MSc in AI and from there I went to work on startups to learn business. Few years later, fed up by all the BS, I went back to program neural networks, work on space technologies and also did a bit of math teaching at a business university.  As a developer I do the same as everybody, a bit of everything (bug fixing), but two areas I focus on more are the fluids and GUIs. Also I am fighting on behalf of capitalism in our lunch economical/political discussions.  I like seeing how everything, all the layers, come together to create the game. You see all those things moving and interacting on the screen, but that is a result of layers of very complicated mechanisms underneath. Honestly, it amazes me that it works, seeing how complicated and fragile it is inside, especially with all the mods.   Ben (Abregado) Buckton  Player experience and Level Design  My version of growing up with video games took place in the 90's. Most games were one-time affairs so when there was a title which had massive replayability, it really stuck. Master of Orion 1 and 2, Populous and Wing Commander: Privateer would be at the top. I also remember a lot of Quake mods at LAN parties.  I am a massive advocate for using games in education. In 2014 I helped found an Australian education company that provides holiday and after-school programs using games as a tool for motivation. Factorio was one of those games. When the team posted an opening for a level designer to make a new tutorial experience, a friend said \"Ben, you'd be crazy not to apply\". So, here I am.  I started with the team early 2018 to build a new scenario that would act as both a Demo and a Tutorial. Plans for a campaign of larger scope came together shortly thereafter. I try to get involved in any discussion about player experience that will affect new players. Removing the pickaxe item was the first suggestion I offered to the team to help new players (sorry, not sorry).  My favorite part of the game has to be how scriptable the game is. There is a crazy amount of things you can do, a lot of which you probably shouldn't! We have seen Dota, MMOs, RPGs and Survival games all made from the humble Factorio engine. As a level designer, it is great to work with a product that is very expandable and a team that value it being so.   Erik (Bilka) Wellmann  Wiki Administrator  I remember sinking hours of my childhood into developing my cities in Die Siedler: Aufbruch der Kulturen, a German part of the Settlers game series. Minecraft was another game that caught my attention growing up, I still occasionally play it, nowadays heavily modded.  I found Factorio just after Steam release and played the game on and off for about a year until I graduated high school. After that, I spent more time playing the game and became wiki admin. Over the next year, I got involved in modding and was granted access to the source code of the game. This increase in involvement ended in me getting hired as a wiki admin and I became part of the team.  When I first joined the team, I just kept doing the wiki admin work that I had already been doing. As time went on, I became interested in programming the game. I started working on small modding interface requests to get to know C++. I like to challenge my skills, so since then my programming projects have become bigger and more complicated, and I have created features like the script rendering.  Factorio is a great game but the best part of it is the community that grew around it. I like helping beginners, following the planning behind megabases, learning from experienced modders and racing against the time together with speedrunners. All this is only possible due to the awesome community.   Sanqui  Dev-ops\r   https://sanqui.net  My favorite games include a variety of titles like Cave Story, Doom, or The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. I did enjoy Minecraft quite a lot when that was the new thing, too. I'm also a fan of more obscure games like Keitai Denjuu Telefang, a Japan-only monster collecting game which I help make an English translation patch for. A special place in my heart is held by the original Pokémon games. Charming, timeless and revolutionary RPGs.  I enjoy tinkering and seeing how things work behind the scenes, so a big hobby of mine is reverse-engineering old video games. In particular I have numerous disassembly and homebrew projects for the venerable Game Boy. I'm a founding member of RetroHerna, a Czech videogame museum project. I'm also an administrator over at The Cutting Room Floor, a site dedicated to documenting unused content in video games.  I'm also a bit of a digital historian and archivist. I take part in Archive Team, where we work hard to preserve websites which are at risk.  Basically, I like to pretend I'm some sort of digital archeologist. Outside of computers, though, I've been growing my interest in nature conservation and birds, in particular real work with birds of prey.  I joined the Factorio team a bit over a year ago by now and my responsibility is the technical side of the website, the mod portal, the forums, the wiki, the matching server... and a lot of internal stuff. I don't work on the game itself, I leave that to the C++ pros. But occasionally I help playtest. I make a good guinea pig because I haven't played Factorio all that much. But I do love the game! The aspect of factory creation, growth, and long-term maintenance is what I really enjoy. Making and exploring worlds will never get old.   Ales (Zopa) Navratil  Graphic Designer  http://zopa-design.cz  When I was a child, there was not many of video games in Czech Republic, but one of the first games I have played and I remember was Wolf & Eggs.  I played some Wolfenstein 3D with friends when it was new, and recently I am trying to cut my way through a playthrough of Factorio, but it is very time consuming.  I have studied high school of graphics and Academy of Arts Architecture & Design in Prague. I have been working in graphical design for 30 years (you can find my website here). I specialize in creating visual identity of companies and brand design. My work on Factorio started by creating a logotype for Wube Software, and fluently continued by cooperating on the new GUI for Factorio.    Dominik Schmaderer  VFX Artist  Growing up, my favorite games were probably the games I played with my brother. This includes a ton of Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario for the SNES. I loved the look and feel of pre-rendered sprites in Donkey Kong Country, understandable why I love the Factorio art style so much. As the younger sibling I was always player number 2 and more or less here to warm the second controller, but I learned to observe the game and the style instead of playing it. I also liked playing the Sonic series, especially the Sega Mega Drive ones as well as Sonic adventure 1 and 2 (yes I said that fight me I love em).  I went to Art school in Vienna, in my graduation year a friend of mine and I got heavily invested in Factorio and we would spend more time playing the game instead actually working on our grad film. We set up meetings to work on our project and worked a bit and would then spend the whole evening playing Factorio.  I joined Factorio in late 2018 so I'm quite new to the team. I work here as an VFX artist alongside some other things, but primarily if it needs to be bleeding, oozing, vomiting, or exploding, that's basically my bit in the team.  For me personally my favorite part of the game is the artstyle! It reminds me of 90s games and it gives me a very nostalgic feeling. Another great aspect of the game for me is the teamwork, when a friend and I had play sessions we would draw up plans and ideas in photoshop and send it to each other, it was quite a lot of fun.

{"page_num": "10", "name": "Friday Facts #297 - New resource icons", "body": "Inserters are now smarter Twinsen  A few days ago I was investigating a rather minor bug report related to \"Rotational Asymmetry in Belt/Inserter interactions\" (aka Inserter was not behaving identically when rotated). This was a classic case of floating point equality comparison.    The Inserter would move it's arm and then it would pick up the item if the current arm orientation is equal to the desired arm orientation. Because of some chain of calculations related to rotation, some precision was lost and the equality check would fail for 1 tick, delaying the item pickup for 1 tick in some Inserter rotations. So I fixed that by finishing the inserter movement if it's close enough. Now the inserters should be a tiny bit faster in some rotations, plus all rotations should again be symmetrical and identical.  While analyzing the code and Inserter behavior for that bug, I also noticed that inserters with stack bonus would do nothing for 1 tick after picking up an item from a belt. I changed it so inserters will start moving to a new target immediately after they pick up something. This also sped up the Stack Inserter by a tiny bit.  Both the speedups were enough to fix another bug that was often regarded by the other devs as \"not a bug\": A Stack Inserter was not fast enough to pick up all the items placed on a belt by another Stack Inserter. Furthermore, because of different timings, the amount of items a Stack Inserter would pick up would depend on how far that Stack Inserter was from the item source:    We released the change on Thursday. Something strange was quickly discovered after release...  From Nefrums speedrun stream.  As someone from Twitch chat noted \"Inserters are so fast now, they even don't care about the side of belt\". Remember that I fixed the rotation problem by finishing the Inserter movement if it's close enough. Well, what ended up happening was what now the Inserter would stop 0.0001 degrees short of perfectly vertical. That was of course closer to the other belt lane so the item would be dropped there. Previously it was always dropped perfectly vertical, and the lane decision algorithm would choose the right lane. The fix was easy and it's probably released by the time you are reading this.  So with everything fixed, inserters are now more consistent, predictable and intuitive, things that I think are important for a precise game like Factorio. Some situation might end up being slightly slower or will consume a bit more electricity, but generally inserters are now faster.

At the very beginning (FFF-1) it was to let people know that \"we're still alive and working on the game\", and over time we've grown into covering a range of different topics:\r  Communicating our progress and roadmap of the next releases.\r Showing new features and gathering community feedback on them.\r Diving into the technical side of game development and particular challenges we face.\r 'Meta-posts' about the company and the changes outside of the game.\r Community spotlights and interesting Factorio related news.  It is always an interesting challenge each week to determine what topics we might be able to cover in the FFF. During the weeks of rapid development the FFF can feel like a triumphant reveal of what we have been working on, and we excitedly await the community response. Other times, such as when most of the team is on bugfixing, we can take the oppourtunity to explore other points of discussion, such as the marketing post last week.  The graph of the FFF readership over the last year is quite informative to look into:    We had a good run back in January and February, we had week after week of really interesting posts and a build-up of excitement for the 0.17 release. Now after the release, the readership has stabilized at around 40-45,000 views a week (note, that the graph does not include people reading the blog post through Steam).  The FFF is close to its 300th post now, with no signs of stopping soon, and the continued audience of dedicated readers each week help to keep us on track and focused on our quest towards 1.0. As we get closer to completion of the game, the general nature of the blog post will no doubt change even further. The good times of showing a new feature each week might be over, but I hope we will be able to provide interesting insights into the game and our development processes. I would also like to thank all the players/readers who share their thoughts with us each week, it is really great to have so much support and care for our project.

{"page_num": "11", "name": "Friday Facts #292 - Inching closer to stable", "body": "Inching closer to stable Klonan  The last 2 weeks have been less productive than we would like on the bug fixing front. The Easter festivities along with a wave of illness have dampened our efforts. We have still managed to push out 2 more experimental releases, and fixed a few desyncs. We encountered one specific desync in the mass MP stress test last weekend, caused by a characters inventory size changing (such as researching the toolbelt technology) while the player is respawning.  The graph of crashes paints a similar story to how the office atmosphere feels. It is natural though, most of the major crashes affecting most players are resolved, so all that remains are the more difficult issues that only affect a handful of players. This means that each bug fix is less effective at reducing the overall crash count.    This last weekend, we had over 500 total crashes reported, which is a slight improvement over the prior weekend's ~650. One thing that makes our progress hard to evaluate is that we don't know how many people are actually playing experimental. Most people play through Steam, and so far we have found no way of determining how many people are opted-in to the 0.17 experimental through Steam. It could be that the game is more stable, or it could be that less people are playing.  There are still over 250 open bug reports on our forum, so it seems it will be a few more weeks until the first stable 0.17.  Some people have been asking when we will release the new GUI and GFX updates that we promised before 0.17 release. The plan is that after the first 0.17 stable version, some of the team will be moved from fixing bugs to working on features. At the point where we have a meaningful amount of new content ready (A few GUIs, some new GFX, etc.), we will release it as a new experimental 0.17 version. We plan to give some explanation and notice about these 'mini-content releases' in a FFF before they are each released.

Over the last year we have been working on the bigger design task of unravelling the tech tree and breaking it into a set of choices for the player.  This task has been made all the more Interesting as the tech tree is also constantly getting tweaks and revisions over that time as well.

{"page_num": "11", "name": "Friday Facts #290 - Rail building changes & High-res icons", "body": "Rail building changes kovarex  The problem with rail building is that it has too many states. It depends whether you start building the rail with shift, to use the ghost mode or not, and then it also matters whether you still hold shift, to ignore trees or not. Moving from manual building to ghost rail building means cancelling the whole rail building and starting it again with the correct modifier.  The problems were reaching the surface from time to time, and Twinsen even drew a nice little state diagram of the rail building system.    It kind of peaked with this bug report. After some time, it became clear that we should simplify it.  This is a nice example, where we can talk about change we just released (0.17.29) in a FFF.  From now on, instead of 3 modes (building manually, ghost building, ghost building + tree/rock removal), we have only 2 modes, where the ghost building without obstacle deconstruction is not available anymore. So it doesn't matter anymore how you start the building, it just matters whether you are holding shift or not at the moment, which makes it consistent with the normal entity building and the ghost icon.    Once the topic is opened, it is hard to leave it so easily, so we agreed that the rail building could be streamlined even more. The current model is, that you have to build one straight piece of rail first, and then you can use the rail builder on the edge of that rail. It is annoying generally, and especially for the new players, because he might miss the way how it is being used, as the straight rails are built exactly the same way as other entities. The reason we did it this way was mainly, because when we first introduced the (new at that time) rail builder, we weren't confident enough that it could replace even the basic straight rail building. But since the rail building is stable enough, we might go one more step forward.  The plan is that the rail won't be used to build straight rails normally the way you can now. The rail item would be always used to build by the rail planner only. Instead of having to snap to an existing rail, you could just start building anywhere on the ground. Instead of showing the rail preview when holding the item, you would see the arrow as when starting the rail building, and you could rotate it with the R key. It would make sense, to make the arrow color/size different for starting a rail planner on the ground versus snapping to an existing rail, but other than that, it would be the same.

The reason is that the patch notes were so big, that it exceeded the maximum post size (40k characters). If this isn't the indication that we should split our releases into smaller chunks, than nothing is :).  Code wise, it is clearly the biggest release, and the amount of bugs we have to go through correlates with it. In other words, there are tons of bugs of all variety. We want to fix everything eventually, but it will take time, so we had to prioritize this week to aim for the most generally playable version before the first weekend after release. That means mainly unloadable saves, unavoidable crashes, game failing on startup, and the most frequently occurring problems. Our automatic bug reporting system is helping us a lot with the last one.  It is uncommon, but sometimes the automatically uploaded crash report doesn't have enough information for us to be able to fix the bug right away, but the number of times we see a crash happening is still extremely useful for prioritizing. When we see a crash on the forum, we can cross reference it to our automatic reports, and if is one of our 'top-hits', we know to investigate it right away. The most prominent crash related to loading specific kind of save happened with pipe ghosts happened more than 200 times.

As it might not be a surprise, the biggest bottleneck of the 0.17 release is the GUI. I like to believe, that we have learned a lot from the pitfalls of the collaborative creative process of GUI. This is the typical way we were redesigning the GUI:  Two to three people started discussing what could be cool to change in the particular GUI. Some people randomly joined and left the ongoing discussion. Arguments to discard certain ideas have to be repeated over and over. Then the discussion is ended because of something. A week later people start talking again, most of them forgot most of the stuff, or were discussing it with different people, so they assume some details of the changes to be understood by everyone, while they aren't. They come to an agreement how it should be done. They have a random discussion about it a week later and figure out, they had completely different ideas about how it should be done, they just didn't articulate them precisely. Both are kind of angry to have to reopen and re-negotiate the subject again. Someone starts to implement the GUI, but half-way through it is uncovered, that there was another layer of misunderstanding when specifying how should the work be done, and we need to go to step 1 again and repeat.  Since many GUIs are thought and worked on in parallel, these situations overlapped and amplified the problems of mixing things up in our heads about what we agreed on in which GUI.  Luckily, we eventually figured out, that it can't be done like this, and since there is a lot of work in the GUI, we need to make a process. It goes like this:  First, there is some general discussion about the GUI, all team members can share their ideas. kovarex + Twinsen sit alone in the office, and discuss for some time (can be hours), all the pros and cons of how things should be done, and make some agreement. Twinsen writes a detailed UX document about the GUI containing the structure, and more importantly the behaviour, in a detailed manner. Twinsen + kovarex discuss the UX document and propose changes until they agree on the final version. Albert + Aleš take the UX document and create a UI mockup based on it. kovarex + Twinsen + Albert agree on the UI mockup or propose changes. Someone is assigned to implement the GUI based on the UX document and UI mockup kovarex reviews that the implementation is correct and points out some inconsistencies that he can see. Part of this step is making sure, that we share as many GUI styles and code as possible across different GUIs. kovarex + Albert have a final look on the implementation and fix final details until they both agree that the screen is fully finished.  Having the UX documents/UI mockups always available proved to be a huge time saver. Not only it helps us to solve the communication problems, we also don't have to remember and re-articulate decisions from some time ago as we can just open the document and see what we agreed on and instantly continue where we left off.  A good part of this strict pipeline is that we now have better knowledge of the state of the work progress.\r \r These are the GUI screens that we hope to deliver for 0.17:  .header_cell\r {\r   text-align:center;\r   font-weight: bold;\r }\r .finished\r {\r   text-align:center;\r   font-weight: bold;\r }\r \r .not_finished\r {\r   text-align:center;\r   font-weight: bold;\r }\r \r .finished_gui_table\r {\r   border-spacing: 10px;\r }\r \r .finished_gui_table td\r {\r   border: 1px;\r   border-style:solid;\r padding: 5px;\r }  General UX UX draft UX review UI mockup UI review Implementation draft Implementation review Final review   Load map           Save map          Graphics settings           Control settings           Sound settings           Interface settings           Other settings           Map generator           Technology GUI           Technology tooltip           Recipe/item/entity tooltip           Action bar           Shortcut bar           Train GUI           Manage/Install mods           Main screen chat           Recipe explorer           Character screen           Menu structure           New game           Help overlay           Chat icon selector           Blueprint library   You can see, that there is still a lot of to do, but the work tends to accelerate as more and more of the GUI layouts/tilesets/standards are being finalized and reused.

This time it is pretty much finished so I can tell you facts instead of just speculations. You will find how the new algorithm will work and some new handy usability features.  In FFF-260 I wrote about how it all started, why we are doing it and what the plan is. There was a huge response from you all and I want to thank everyone for their contributions. Let me apologise to redditors, as at the beginning I started responding on the forums and when I realized there is reddit too, there were too many comments for me to handle.  The forum users produced many ideas on how the system could work. About third of them was a fluid teleportation, many where known but many were entirely new and interesting. What intrigued me was the large variety of backgrounds they came from - differents kinds of engineers (mechanical, CS, electrical, ...), mathematicians, physicists, and even people with real pipes hands on experience. I won’t go through them here, you can find them on the forums or reddit. There were two proposals on the forum though that were so good that they made it into the game - from quinor and TheYeast.  Both of these proposals were very similar and kinda similar to the previous game logic. What it shares is that the mechanic still uses fluid physics simulation and volume in a pipe as a base for the movement calculation. As a result, not much changes on the first glance. What they add though is an emphasis on the fluid network update being independent on the current state (i.e. updating one pipe only depends on state from the last tick) and is therefore independent on evaluation order, which was one of the big pains of the old model that led to sometimes ridiculous junction behavior. Difference between these two was rather small - quinor’s version allowed perfect throughput with 3 passes over the fluidboxes (fluidbox is the thing managing fluids for entities, so I will talk about them), while Yeast’s one was 2 pass with ¼ throughput. What was outstanding though is that TheYeast, a physicist, supported the model with a nice theoretical background and what’s more, he made an amazing JS simulator to test and compare various modification of the model. Because that extra pass in quinor’s version was too high a price for the perfect throughput, I went with TheYeast’s two pass one.  Since the old algorithm only used a single pass run by entities for the update, I first needed to overhaul the whole system to allow accommodating the new one. Going from one pass to two passes necessarily means higher complexity, so we made a big effort to optimize everything we could to make sure we will still end up faster than 0.16.

Last year Factorio was actually selected as a nominee for the 'Haunts My Dreams' award.    There is a category this year for 'Best Developer', and many in the community have wanted to nominate us for that category. Unfortunately to be eligible, we would need to have a developer page set up on Steam.  We had some discussions, and decided to wait until we have a final 'Wube Software' logo and theme finalized before setting up a developer page. This means you won't be able to vote for us as best developer this year...  This doesn't meant that you can't nominate Factorio for one of the categories, and there has already been some discussion on the subreddit about which games people are voting for.

The original plan was to finish everything, and release the final version of Factorio ideally before the end of 2018. This was the plan at the beginning of the year. We worked in our usual way of \"it is done when it is done\" for quite some time, but then it started taking a little bit too long, and we weren't even sure what is a realistic timeframe to finish it in.  To help this issue, we tried to become a little more organized in the past few weeks. We went through our list of all the development tasks, and tried to finalize it. We removed all the things that we decided to cut, and added all the missing things that we need to do before the game is finished. Then we tried to make some kind of time estimate for each task, to get a general idea of when everything will be finished. We started to be more conscious of who is working on what, and how much time each task is taking, to know how accurate the estimates are. The result was, that if it all goes well, we could be done in 6-9 months. This is probably not something you wanted to hear.  After a few rounds of discussions, we decided split the releases of 0.17 and 0.18 in the following way:  0.17 plan \r It will contain all the things we have done up to this point, mainly:\r  New render backend, which helps performance and solves a lot of issues (FFF-251) The graphical updates: walls, gates, turrets, belts, biters, spawners, electric poles (FFF-268, FFF-228, FFF-253) The GUI reskin (FFF-243) New map editor (FFF-252) Resource generation overhaul (FFF-258) Robot construction tools (FFF-255) Rich text (FFF-237, FFF-267) And more...  It will also include some things we know we can finish soon enough, mainly:  Redoing some of the most important GUIs (Action bar, character screen, main game GUI, train GUI, play GUI, tooltips) Fluid optimisations And several smaller things, which depends on how it goes  We will release this during January 2019, we will announce it more precisely in advance.  0.18 plan\r It will become the final 1.0 version once it is stable. It will contain mainly:\r  New tutorial New campaign Final mini tutorials Revision of rest of the GUI All remaining high res graphics graphics and final polish \r We obviously don't know exactly when is it going to be ready, but we hope it to be sooner than 9 months from now.

They are the locals, and somehow, from a twisted perspective, they can even be considered the bad guys. Not anymore. The magic of high resolution gives us the chance to move deeper into their conceptualisation and we've added a new ingredient to their formulation: cute...-ish.  For the last couple of weeks Ernestas and I have been working on the new version of the biters. Together we worked on developing the concept and ideas behind them, and Ernestas was doing the rest: modeling, texturing, shading, rigging, skinning, animating, rendering, post-processing, and being patient with me and my constant comments and changes.  Cute is how we like them, we want you to feel sorry about planning massive biter massacres. In fact we want you to feel pity towards them, especially when you are killing them and destroying their habitat at industrial scale. But also we want you to be disgusted by them, because they are alien to you, and they need to look the part, so it is quite a complicated equation.    Basically after the experience in-game with the classic version, we've learned what aspects of the biters are working well, and how to improve the parts which aren't. So we've decided to elongate their legs and accent their eyes in order to provide this more insectoid feeling. Also their new design is optimized for their attacks, they have 2 stronger front legs for providing destruction, 4 back legs to be able to run and stand during the attack, and stronger articulated mandibles to chew on your factories.    In these animations we can fully see the potential of disgust, the way they move now is more insect-like, similar to a cockroach (many people are disgusted by cockroaches), and also we've balanced the animation loop with their speed in the game, so they shouldn't slide around.  Keep in mind that this is still a work-in-progress and we have some more tweaks to do and extra animations to make, like their attack and death. We are also working on their sound design, and apart from that we might have some other surprises to make killing them extra gratifying to watch.

As it is always appearing, it adds unnecessary clutter to the screen. It is always blinking there, while 99% of the time it is not really needed.  So we experimented with entity info as a tooltip next to the cursor when hovering the entity:    So we tested 3 different ways to activate it:\r  It always appears at the cursor, which has the disadvantage of always being in your way in the middle of the screen. It always appears, but it has some delay. It only appears when a hotkey is pressed (we tested it with Shift), which has the disadvantage that you have to actually do something to see it.  We assigned each of the options to be tested by someone, with the hope to figure out which (if any) of them is better than the current one. Vaclav tested option 1, Twinsen tested option 2 and I tested option 3.  Unfortunately the result was that in the end everyone preferred his option the most, and we had no conclusion at all. Then we realized that the flaw of the test was that each of us picked the kind of option we already knew we would probably like.  After some discussions, we decided on the following:\r  The current version of entity info will be the default.\r We add an option to set a custom delay for it, that is different than the normal tooltip delay (or never).\r We add an option to activate it with a key.\r We add an option to have it next to cursor or on the side.  Two years ago, I was under the impression, that we need to eradicate all the weird options, to make the game just work for everyone. Over time and after all experience and feedback we have gathered, I started to realize that different people have different expectations, and their brains are wired differently.

{"page_num": "14", "name": "Friday Facts #265 - Nomenclature & Steam networking", "body": "Factorio Nomenclature Abregado  Today I want to discuss some common problems that we see in video games.  Inconsistent Terminology  When I asked out loud \"So what is an Intermediate Product anyway?\", I got a similar reaction as when someone mentions The Berlin Interpretation at a rougelike convention. So what is an Intermediate Product? Well it is a product that is used only as an ingredient for something else. No, that's not right because Science Packs are not used in any recipe. So what then, Intermediate products are just things that you can use Productivity Modules on? Perhaps they are simply items that can be found in the Intermediate Crafting menu. Then are they not Intermediate Recipes?  To give another example, answer these questions:\r  Name the action a player performs when they add an entity to the world?\r Name the action a player performs when they remove an entity from the world?\r Name the action a player performs when they add a ghost entity to the world?\r Name the action a robot performs when they add an entity to the world?\r Name the action a robot performs when they remove an entity from the world?  Here are a few situations where the game displays your possible answers:  A player builds.  A player mines entities.  Robots repair and build entities, but wait… the player places buildings and builds ghosts?  But here Robots are constructing machines.  Here the robots are deconstructing items!  This leads into a discussion about what is an item and what are entities, and that discussion leads us into the next point...  Internal nomenclature leaking out  During game development it is very common to use internal names to refer to mechanics, items, or characters. It does not feel like such a big deal, and many early access games simply ignore the problem completely. I'm not going to point any fingers, but if you look you will find some examples. Oh wait, here is some from your favourite early access game!  Internally, things that exist on a surface in the game are called entities.  All these items are capsules internally, but only 5 of them are actually labelled as capsules.  Really, these should be categorised by how players use them, and indeed there is an attempt to do so. Remotes are items used to trigger an effect, Grenades are things you throw... but why is the Poison Capsule not called a gas grenade?  There are more inconsistencies but to keep this article reasonably not-short, I will let you find the others yourself (and to save something for a future FFF about Tooltips).  Why change?  You might be thinking that this is not a big problem. Some others might be thinking that the problem is too pervasive to bother changing. There are a few reasons why it is important, the first, and most important of which is our quality mindset; everyone on the team here wants the game to be as great as possible.  Next we should see this increase the quality of the translations. A translation is only as good as its source, and having a consistent usage of words can go a long way to helping the translators do better work. The effect of this can be increased by providing a dictionary of important words to the translators so they can be sure to always use the same term in all places.  Since we are also working on a guided experience (Campaign), this would also help us give much clearer instructions to the player. An example of confusion here would be if one quest said \"Place a chest\" and another said \"Place the item in the chest\". The player needs to read the entire quest caption (probably twice), and can never build up a mental map of our language. This leads to the player spending more mental energy (cognitive load) while playing the game. Changing this to \"Build a chest\" and being consistent, allows the player to create mental shortcuts, meaning the quest tasks require less effort to understand.  Finally, consistency in terminology will help new players, and I don't just mean sub-1 hour playtime players. Factorio is a 'Big Game' and players are encountering new items, entities, concepts, and text for a long time. How many hours did you play before you discovered this helpful trick, or this one?  How to change?  We could make the vocabulary consistent with what the current player base uses. This option sounds pretty good until I started asking people questions similar to those I asked you at the beginning of the article. Here are another two as a refresher:  Where do biters come from?\r I come in 7 colors, what am I?  The only wrong answer is if you said there was only a single right answer.  Prepare your rotten tomatoes, Ben is about to say something unpopular. The influx of players that are to be expected from 1.0 give us an interesting option. We could theoretically change the vocabulary of the game to be more consistent, reasonable, and generally more helpful to players. Then, as new players join the community, this new language will slowly replace the old.  This would help ease communication between all players; veterans and new addicts alike. Consistency will also help polish the experience to the level that players expect from the game.  Who should change it?  Before Rseding jumps in with some awesome news, I would ask you to have your say in this Google form. It will be fun to see what you come up with, and I will publish the results in a few weeks.

{"page_num": "14", "name": "Friday Facts #263 - Trains in blueprints", "body": "Trains in blueprints  Building trains again and again might be a daunting task. Especially when you start making a lot of mining outposts, artillery/supply trains with filtered cargo wagon slots etc.  So I decided that we should extend blueprints to work with trains as well. The first condition was, that trains are only selected when you explicitly allow it in the checkbox, so they don't get in your way when building rail setups.    Checking the button allows the train that was there to be put into the blueprint (similar to the way tiles work). For the sake of simplicity, we decided that once there is any rail in the blueprint, the train in it will be always buildable (as a ghost obviously), even if there are not rails to support the train at the moment. The train ghost will simply stay there and won't be buildable until rails are placed under it in a way so it can be placed.      If I remove the rails from the blueprint, I get a second type of rail blueprint. In this case, all the parts of need to have rails to support it, this is mainly needed as without rails, there is no rail grid forced, so we should make sure, the train ghost won't be created in some wrong position.      The small touch here is, that the blueprint also contains the schedule. With little-bit of improvisation, I can optimize the mine building a lot in the late game. I create a blueprint of mine train station. The stop will be called \" Mine X\".  Both of the trains in the blueprint will have the \" Mine X\" -> \" Smelting\" schedule setup. Once I build the blueprint, I just rename the \" Mine X\" to whatever I want (\" Mine 12\" for example), and the train schedules are updated as well, so I'm almost ready to go.    The last tweak I'm considering is to allow blueprints to contain the fuel insertion info similar to how they contain the module insertion info for assembling machines now.

{"page_num": "14", "name": "Friday Facts #261 - Performance + New player interaction", "body": "The many lessons learned from testing the new tutorial  We have already pointed out, that we are trying to make a new campaign (FFF-245), and part of it is the core beginning, the NPE/tutorial.  The tutorial is one of the very critical parts of the game, as if the first 15 minutes of a game feels shitty, there is big chance that the player will not play any further. I had this experience in many games myself.  So the challenge could be articulated like this: \"The current tutorial is okay, but can we make it great?\"\r The approach in the current tutorial is to feed the player with the basic knowledge of how to control the basics of the game (the first mission and the start of the second mission) in the fastest way possible.    The player is even given descriptive info like this, to diminish the chance of not understanding how the basic entities work.    After few steps in the 2nd level, the player can start exploring his first self-feeding loop (make iron to make more iron).   The tools used to this is mainly: The message dialog that stops the game and explains the player various things. Minimization of the amount of things the player can interact with to absolute minimum, so he can't start doing other things before the basics are clear. The possible drawbacks: The constant interruptions can get really annoying (typically around 22 message dialogs before the player starts to play relatively freely in the 2nd level). The possibility, that the player will mindlessly follow the step-by step tasks without understanding it, so he can become really lost later on, and the tutorial basically wouldn't help him to understand things.  So the question is: Can we make a tutorial that makes these problems go away?, and alternatively, How big are these problems actually?  The current direction of the new tutorial attempt is to never use the message dialogs, so the player can learn the game more fluently, and to leave way more things to explore, as learning things yourself has a better chance of success than force-feeding generally.  We made a few tests of the new approach with a few people, the main takeaway, is that nothing is for free, and this approach created new drawbacks.\r  If the player doesn't figure out something basic, it can be very frustrating for him to figure out what is going on when not moving forward for a long time. It might be possible, that some things are just not fun to learn by exploration, and it is more comfortable if they are force fed to you. I would compare this to a friend explaining you how to play a game for 5 minutes compared to 2 hours of trial and error.  There are more possible outcomes from this, and we shall see how different tweaks of both strategies work in the testings. It might be interesting if you mentioned your experience with the tutorial in the comment section as well.

{"page_num": "14", "name": "Friday Facts #259 - Scan-codes, Prototype IDs, HR worm", "body": "Scan-codes vs Key-codes (posila)  While migrating from Allegro to SDL, HanziQ and Jiri replaced the keystroke handling from using key-codes to scan-codes. Before you start jumping with joy, you’ll probably wonder: What is that and why should I care?  Well, funny you should ask. You probably won’t care, unless you live outside of USA and/or you use a non-US keyboard layout. In short, key-code is a key identifier dependant on the symbol the key will output when pressed, scan-code is a key identifier based on the physical location of a key. So for example players with French keyboard layout (AZERTY) have to jump to the control options after launching the game for the first time, and remap movement from WASD to ZQSD, in order to be able to move their character without hurting their hand.    In 0.17, the controls will map to the correct keys by default, regardless of your layout, and stay mapped to those physical keys even if you for some reason change your keyboard layout while the game is running. The disadvantage is, most of the non-US layouts didn’t end up with completely broken controls, so people kept playing with them and got used to them. So they’ll need to get used to the layout the game was originally designed with, or manually configure controls back to what they are used to.  But wait, there is a catch...  A few weeks ago we have announced new construction tools, which are by default bound to quite universal shortcuts (Ctrl+C for copy, Ctrl+X for cut and Ctrl+Z for undo). Bilka pointed out that the German keyboard has Z swapped with Y (as does the Czech one, but developers often don't use it) and undo incorrectly defaults to Ctrl+Y instead. To fix these kind of shortcuts we determine the appropriate default scan-codes at start-up, so that undo is always Ctrl+Z, regardless of your layout, but the action will stay bound to those keys if you change keyboard layout at runtime, which is hopefully a reasonable compromise.  We might do it for other controls too (it feels natural for M to always be the default key to open the map, and T to open the technology screen), but there is another catch. It is completely reasonable for player to walk north, and Ctrl+click some entities. Remember AZERTY keyboard? Player keeps Z pressed down to walk north and presses Ctrl to start control clicking. Well, I tested this and it doesn’t trigger undo, but still stops player from walking. So it is not completely destructive, rather annoying. I am not sure how or if we’ll solve this, perhaps people with these layouts that create these kind of collisions will need resolve them by changing controls options manually.

{"page_num": "14", "name": "Friday Facts #258 - New autoplace", "body": "Taming the random generatorTwinsen  One of the things in the large TODO list for 0.17 is giving a final polish to the map generator.  There are quite a few obvious problems now in 0.16, and some less obvious ones. Here are some of the fixes and improvements (some work in progress):\r \r  All combinations of settings should no longer create strange maps such as circles of cliffs. Much more predictable starting area resources that don't overlap each-other and are not covered by water. The resource generation settings now have a much more dramatic effect (previously they had little to no effect). Increased the number of steps (small, medium, big, etc) for each setting from 5 to 9 for even more customization. The starting area will always contain water, most often a lake close to the spawn position. Since the algorithm for generating ores was pretty much completely rewritten, there are many small improvements.  Now for the less obvious problem: unpredictability. I saw quite a few people complain with vague comments like \"the map generator sucks\". So I often asked them what the problem is in detail. Some were complaining about the above problems, some did not understand what the settings do, and some had problems finding a \"good map\". I saw quite a few players click \"regenerate\" like crazy until they got a map with fat patches in the starting area, big oil patch and also uranium, complaining that it's too hard to find a \"good map\". Due to the randomness we seem to have set the expectation for \"good map\" a bit too high. Oil and uranium were never intended to be in the starting area, but due to the randomness of the generator they sometimes were there. Also sometimes maps were so wild that you would start off either swimming in resources or desperately looking for another iron patch.  It would be simple to just say \"that's just RNG, deal with it\", but blaming poor game experience on RNG is just bad design.\r So what we did is:\r  The starting area contains only iron, copper, coal and stone, in very predictable amounts. Uranium and oil are explicitly excluded from the starting area. Starting area resources are usually in one ore patch each (depending on settings). The starting area patches are usually close together. The starting area size setting no longer affects resource placement, it just has a fixed size.  Outside the starting area, the regular algorithm \"kicks in\" so you can still get quite wild results, but they are far enough that it averages out. I believe this is a good balance where you can still have different experiences depending on your luck, but your starting experience is much more predictable and does not leave you with the feeling that you got screwed over by the map generator. We definitely don't want the map generator to be extremely flat and predictable. Opinions on the subject are quite wild too, with people having different expectations of what a good map should look like, so we try to only make changes based on actual problems.  This might seem a bit controversial so we can add an option that disables this whole starting area logic, for purists.  We plan some small tweaks coming to biters also (a tiny bit more biters close to the starting area), small tweaks to terrain, cliffs, water generation and possibly some new features to make the generated trees and decoratives look better.  Most of these problems including the obvious and apparently simple ones were not that easy to solve. It's hard to make random generators do what you want, so TOGoS will explain what it took to actually get it done.

Also we were working on the sound of the biter nests and the artillery cannon. This is definitely a huge subject full of details that can really improve the play experience of Factorio. Here I can show you a work in progress of the artillery cannon:    We have to tweak some behaviour of the entity in order to make it act more mechanical, but overall, the possibilities that sound design can bring to the game are really interesting. Compare the simple shooting of the cannon in the actual version with this proof of concept with all those details in rotation and loading. Of course this level of detail complicates the work a little bit, but I'm convinced it's worth it.

Mod deprecation  A modder can mark a mod as deprecated, which indicates they are no longer updating or maintaining it. The typical case is a mod will add something relevant for the current version of the game (E.G, a mod to scan the players starting area), and then an update to the base game makes the mod obsolete. Just deleting the mod could potentially cause problems for people playing an older version, people might ask what has happened to it etc.    Marking as deprecated will keep the mod up on the portal, but it will be hidden from any public searches. This way people downloading using 'Sync mods with save' feature can keep playing, while new players won't stumble upon a mod that is no longer useful or up to date. It also preserves the downloads and discussions in case the author wants to revive it later.  Collaborators  It is often the case, that a mod author will want someone else to help them maintain and manage their mod, for instance if they are going on holiday when a major release is coming out. The way it has worked in the past, another modder would have to come and upload an updated version of the mod under their own name. Now a modder can set another player as a 'collaborator', which means they can help out will all the maintenance of the mod. Collaborators can do everything the author can do, except add or remove collaborators.    You might also spot the other feature, transferring mod ownership. This lets the author give the mod completely to a collaborator, in the case that they are no longer interested in working on the mod at all.  Discussions notice  Mod authors can now display a notice above their mod page discussions, informing the users of any useful information. For example, an author might prefer you to report bugs on their GitHub page, so the notice will inform users of where they should go. An additional option allows the author to disable the discussions completely, in the case they have their own forum/thread somewhere for discussions.    If you have any ideas for an improvement to the mod portal, please let us know on our Mod portal discussion subforum.

{"page_num": "15", "name": "Friday Facts #247 - Pricing and its exploits", "body": "Regional pricing exploit (Klonan)  Earlier this week I received an unusual number of support emails, some players were having trouble redeeming their Steam keys on our website. In each case, the key they purchased was not a key eligible for a Steam key. Our order/account system isn't the most intuitive, so let me explain the ways in which people can buy the game, and how it relates to our website:  Our website - You buy from our website, and you get a key from the Humble checkout. You use this key to upgrade an account, and you can redeem a Steam key. Steam - You buy on Steam, which adds it to your Steam account. You then link your Steam on our website, which upgrades your account. Humble Store - You buy a Steam key, which you activate on Steam, and then follow the steps above. GOG - You buy the game on GOG, which lets you download the DRM free version. You can also redeem a retail key, to upgrade your account.  So in the cases above, the only way to get a Steam key from our website, is by buying directly on our website. The players in question managed to get their hands on 3rd party retail keys. These retail keys aren't distributed for reselling anywhere, so the fact I was seeing a lot of emails coming in about these keys, was an indication something fishy was going on.  The source of these keys is GOG, I double checked this my comparing some of the keys these people purchased with the list of keys we generated for GOG, and they matched. My first suspicion was someone cheesing the GOG return policy, buying the game, redeeming the key, and then refunding it. I emailed our contact and there were only 21 refunds in the last 3 months, so it was not the case.  The second suspicion was that the GOG server was breached somehow. They reported no incident, but we disabled all the unredeemed keys anyway just to be sure. I checked with the list again, and none of the keys that we deactivated were used by any account. This led to the conclusion, at the very least, these keys were purchased legitimately.  So people are legitimately buying keys, GOG confirmed sales had shot up in the last week. Then the question, where are the sales coming from? One last email to GOG and we had our answer: Russian Federation. The reason? We have regional pricing on GOG at parity with Steam, which means someone buying from Russia could buy the game for ~$8.30. Once they buy on GOG, they can redeem the retail key, and sell it for about $20 on a 3rd party site. So one clever guy saw this opportunity, and started buying the game hundreds of times on GOG. The immediate solution is to remove the regional pricing, and in the long term we may be able to implement some 'GOG linking' similar to the current system for Steam users.  It is strange that it was only taken advantage of recently, as we have had regional pricing since our launch on GOG 2 years ago. It may be related to the recent price increase.

{"page_num": "16", "name": "Friday Facts #245 - Campaign concept", "body": "Being brought in to create content on a very mature project has been an interesting experience to say the least. One of the first things I did was analyse the features of the game and which kind of player the game currently supports. The obvious thing is that Factorio Freeplay strongly attracts and engages players who enjoy an open-ended sandbox type of game. Achievement statistics show that only about 11% of players on Steam have ever launched a rocket, which currently means 'won the game'.    What about the other player types? Well for those that are new to the game, or unsure if they are interested, we will have the New Player Experience. This is a free, combined tutorial and demonstrator mission which we discussed in FFF-241. But what about those that prefer a guided experience? This is the sort of player who wants to play the game, and experience all of what it has to offer, but wants to be taken on a journey. For these players we have the campaign. Why do we need a new campaign at all? We find that the current campaign: Does not include all the Freeplay content as it currently ends after Advanced Circuits.\r Severely limits player investment by forcing a new factory to be built each mission.\r Does not convey the feeling of loneliness that the Freeplay does.\r Is showing its age visually, as it was made before high-res textures and the terrain rework.  To solve these issues we have set about designing new Campaign elements to act consistently to provide the player with a guided experience all the way from Science pack 1 to Space science packs.  The first step to achieving this is to have the map border expand each time the player completes a section of the main 'quest line'. This means that the player never loses any of their progress, and as long as these transitions are presented in a smooth way, the jarring effect of the old level restarts will be removed.    Having a continuously expanding map presents many other challenges, but we are confident that it will be worthwhile. This style of level will fit with the style of Factorio much better.  Such a map should also end up being as huge as a regular Freeplay environment so as to better place importance on exploration. Exploration in Freeplay is generally player motivated, such as when you are almost out of iron and need to find that next big patch. In a guided experience, letting the player know that there is something out there can give them impetus to dive into the unknown. This brings us to technologies.  Now that we have removed level transitions, we have also shot ourselves in the foot. How else will we deliver the technology tree in chunks? Simply making the entire tree available from the start of the game will cause all sorts of balance issues. In our NPE discussion we stated that new recipes should only be given to the player via research. In the campaign, unresearched technologies will only be given by moving to given locations on the map. These would include some non-generated terrain and pre-placed factory structures to help to player see where they are. These could also help to show concepts and workable designs, one thing that the current campaign does do well.

Hi, I'm Ben (Abregado). My experience as an educator using Factorio in the classroom means I have thoroughly examined new players (young and old), and have played the first 30 minutes of Factorio for as many hours as some players spend on a single megabase. The systems in Factorio are deep and interconnected, so creating an onboarding experience for a single concept poses many exciting challenges.  We find that the Freeplay portion of the game is already enjoyable to its target audience, but those who prefer a more guided experience only get a short campaign which doesn’t even utilize all of the features we’ve added to the game. On top of that brand new players need to dig through a tutorial which takes about 30-45 minutes to get to automation, which is what the game is about.  We want to keep the demo so that anybody who wants to try the game can do it for free, and get a proper representative introduction to what Factorio is. For Factorio, the demo should serve a dual purpose of a tutorial and a teaser, both of which we feel could be improved...  Currently we find the demo has the following problems:  The impact of the first level isn’t very visually representative of what Factorio is.\r Gives the impression of being a Minecraft clone in the first tutorial mission by having to mine manually and do hand crafting.\r Key concepts like Assembling machines and electricity are not presented for the first two levels.\r Player actions are so heavily constrained that the player learns just how to solve the tutorial rather than learning the concepts we are trying to demonstrate.\r Each of the levels is disconnected from the previous. Which item recipes are available, that there are suddenly built structures and the location is completely different.\r Grindy tasks like obtaining X resources in 2nd tutorial mission don’t have any clear purpose. The player does it because they are being told to, not to achieve some other goal that would make sense in the progression.\r A lot of information is not important and just floods the player with noise, for example many of the  messages.\r The places where the player gets information are scattered - Objective window in the top left, the player character talking to themselves in the console chat and the yellow \"TAB bubbles\".    The three different information channels competing for attention. In this case also two of them telling you the same self-explanatory information (where is the current objective shown, if you didn’t get it), while the chat informs you that your character is alive.    A typical objective without purpose. (I guess the game will tell me what is it for soon?)    Doesn’t this message resemble another game? What we would like to achieve with the new design: Create an immediately gripping environment that better sets up the Factorio feel.\r Showing and teaching core concepts like Assembling machines and electricity in the first level using as little complexity as possible.\r Providing goals through the technology tree, working with laboratories and the technology GUI as soon as possible.\r Standardize the way players obtain new items. Every recipe has to be obtained through a technology - that way the player triggers recipe progression and gets them as a reward.\r Starting a new level should start the player at a similar progression state where the previous mission left off.\r Teaching by experimentation instead of jumping through arbitrary tasks. Letting the player coming up with their own solution of a puzzle.\r Unify the channels the player gets information from (mostly GUI improvements).  After finishing the demo, the player should be ready to continue by playing the main campaign, or jump straight to the Freeplay.

This is why we bet for a neutral and sober look that helps to focus on the relevant elements, without the distraction of possible decorative elements.

So we thought it would be much better to \"just\" take a giant screenshot of a working factory, print it, and done! Now of course it’s much more complicated than that…  The first obvious hurdle is that you need a savegame to take this screenshot of. So you go and try to take a bunch of random saves on your disk, you open them and find that it’s not so easy to just find a factory which would look nice.

{"page_num": "17", "name": "Friday Facts #231 - Belt compression & Crash log uploading", "body": "Belt compression (kovarex)  The decision of how to approach the belt compression in 0.16 was not an easy one, we were basically facing two possibilities:  Splitters are the only way to reliably compress a belt. Compression is automatic everywhere (inserters, sideloading, mining drills).  Non-automatic belt compression is kind of an nice example of emergent gameplay mechanic that I liked. It was not forced on players, but it allowed to get some extra efficiency if they cared enough. On other hand, the solution to the problem is kind of obvious, and having to use it in all the setups everywhere might add more repetitiveness than fun. So after some discussions, we decided to make compression automatic.  But we weren't really sure how to do it. The problem is, that once the items are pseudo-randomly added to the belt, with lot of gaps not big enough for another items to fit, it is not clear how should the additional inserters compress it:    The solution was, that whenever there is any gap bigger than the standard distance between items on a belt, item can be inserted there and for a (usually) brief moment, the items are squashed together closer than usual. But once the belt starts moving, the gap between the two squashed item extends to the standard size. This change required us to do some fundamental changes to the belt logic, which could introduce a lot of new problems, but since we just wanted this to be resolved in 0.16, we had to do it now.  The result is, that the same setup in 0.16.25+ results in perfectly compressed belt:    The belt mechanics are now easier to use, but the game also flows more nicely. The belt flow still needs to be controlled and belt balancers are still needed. As that feels to be the more interesting part of belt handling to me, I am happy with the final result.

Jitka started her vacation by staying there to visit the Taiwan island.\r We stayed there for 7 days (2 days in the business area, 3 days in the convention area and 2 days of free time where we visited the city).  In the business area we met many potential business partners and got way too many business cards. We made some friends among the other indie developers and tried all kinds of fun, weird, interesting and some bad indie games.  The convention area was very crowded, with 350,000 visitors slowly trying to make their way through the fairly small convention hall. I can't speak for the others, but I still enjoyed myself. Even though it was crowded, most of the games were in Chinese, and I only got to try one AAA game, there is something about being surrounded by games, gamers, and game developers that makes me feel great. Our booth was in the indie area. We had many people coming to try the game but also many fans wanting to speak with us and congratulate us for making a great game. AndrewIRL who lived there for a few years, invited us for dinner to \"the best restaurant in the city\", and we were not disappointed.  Factorio is not an easy game to demo, since it takes at least 30 minutes to kind of understand what the game is about. But having the trailers looping on the screen, and having subtitles for the gameplay trailer meant that the people got a fair idea about what the game is about and how complex it is. While not the best, we had people start by playing the campaign. Most of them were leaving after the first level but some of them were also getting addicted and playing for multiple hours. We gave free Steam keys to some of the people who were more engaged with the game. It was a learning experience to see people play the game for the first time and to see the most common problems with the campaign, the interaction, the UI and the Traditional Chinese translation.  The days were super exhausting though, many of us collapsing at the accommodation and sleeping for 10 hours. Luckily we had 2 more days to relax and enjoy the city before flying back. We mostly split up and each of us visited what they were most interested in, with me going through the electronics markets and riding a rented bike through the rainy streets.  To give credit where credit is due, I'd like to thank the game show for inviting us and sponsoring our booths, and Razer for conveniently lending us the laptops we used to demo the game.\r Financially there is no point in us going to a game show, our attendance did not bring us any extra sales in Asia, as expected. The point of going there, for us, is to visit the show floor, play and see random games, make gamer friends, meet fellow developers, meet big fans of the game and maybe make some business partners.\r Since many of you mentioned PAX and some of us are interested in going there, we are trying to see if we can attend PAX East this year (April 5-8th). So you might have another opportunity to come and take selfies with some of the Factorio devs.  From left to right: Jitka, Albert, Twinsen, kovarex.

{"page_num": "18", "name": "Friday Facts #228 - High resolution turrets", "body": "Bugfixing report (posila)  Stabilization goes well, the game seems to be quite stable right now (as in - not many crashes are being reported), in fact I think we are at the phase where additional bugfixing makes the game less stable, because more bugs are introduced than fixed, or some critical bug slips through our automated tests. But there are still lot of issues that need to be resolved before we declare 0.16 stable and move on to 0.17 development - the largest issue being belt compression problems.  We finally fixed compatibility problem with OS X 10.9 Mavericks after it was broken in 0.15.40, when we updated our development environment to a newer version of boost, and was still broken in 0.16.x despite of us completely replacing boost with standard libraries from a newer version of C++. However, we might drop Mavericks support in 0.17, as we are considering migrating the game to OpenGL 4.1, which won’t be available on Macs that are unable to run a newer version of macOS.  Speaking of OpenGL, we have several reports of the game crashing in rendering on Linux when the game is disturbed somehow (for example window resizes, loses focus or user switches workspaces), even though it is terribly inconvenient, the game seems to be otherwise playable on these configurations, and we don’t want to spend a terrible amount of time trying to figure out what is wrong with our current rendering system, when we plan to do complete overhaul of it in 0.17. We will investigate these issues, but they might go unresolved until 0.17.  I’ve been looking into some corrupted saves this week, still not being able to figure out how these mysterious corruptions occur. For example this save had two iron ore entities on two different chunks saved with zero entity ID. This could have happened only if those entities had a wrong pointer to the iron ore prototype, so when the game read the ID from the prototype on saving, it would read a value from some random part of memory, or if the ID was corrupted on copying from the prototype to buffer that is saved to disk. Since these kind of corruptions seem to be relatively rare, we suspect it might caused by random hardware failures (maybe cosmic ray hitting a transistor and flipping bit somewhere?), but it would be nice to have some proof it is not some dangling pointer in our code that causes random parts of memory to be overwritten by who knows what.  One way to test it would be to check for tile corruptions. Tile data for a chunk is allocated in a 4kB array at the beginning of the chunk. We could create custom allocator for chunks, so that data structure representing chunk is aligned to virtual pages. That way tile data would occupy a whole single virtual page which we could flag as read only. Then, if due to a bug we write over tile data, the OS would crash the game and we would get a stacktrace and crash dump to investigate. But if a cosmic ray would hit the RAM and flip a bit, the corrupted save would still be produced. However, we currently don’t do any custom allocation of virtual pages, so it might be quite hard to implement. We also need to change tiles sometimes (when map generation runs, when player uses concrete or landfill, when a script changes tiles, etc.) and we don’t know how expensive it would be to change pages from read only to read-write and then back to read only. So it might be just easier to spend two hours on fixing a broken save that someone sends us once every week or two.

{"page_num": "18", "name": "Friday Facts #219 - Cliffs", "body": "Cliffs - introduction and gameplay (Twinsen)  Several months ago TOGoS (Dan) half-jokingly mentioned that what Factorio really needed was mountains and cliffs. This was also suggested many many many times.\r Albert immediately got very excited and they started having some discussions about how to make it happen.  Fast forward a few months, and Ernestas had made some cliff graphics that looked really nice when layered onto pretty much any type of terrain. Fast forward a few more months and add a few months of programming and polishing, and cliffs are almost done, so we will be showing them to you today.  Cliffs, together with the other map changes TOGoS did, should make the map look much more diverse and interesting compared to 0.15. Hopefully it will make exploration more fun, since you will be finding more diverse and unique areas in the world.  Since cliffs block your path, they can affect gameplay significantly. To not make this annoying, cliffs are never too long and often have gaps. We tried to balance the length so they will be long enough to create interesting combat situations, or with some modifications serve as a natural wall against the biters, but so long that they block your path when you want to get somewhere. Cliffs will also not appear in the starting area, to give you plenty of space for your initial base.  Finally, in Factorio nothing should stand in the way of automation, so if you don't like cliffs, you can always blow them up using a new mid-game item called \"Cliff explosives\".\r  Cliffs - graphics (Albert)\r Map generation is hard mainly because it is procedurally generated. That means that the computer is mixing all the pieces to create the terrain on the fly. This leads the artists to a very difficult situation,because it is very hard to guess in which conditions the tilesets will be used.    Factorio terrain 0.1\r We started the generation of terrain in Factorio with very basic rules, mainly mixing clusters of 32px tiles. But obviously that wasn't enough.\r      Factorio terrain 0.3\r  With better looking tiles, transitions from one terrain to another, and variations of tiles, terrain looks much better. But this technique was a pain for the artist to generate an interesting and detailed tileset. The 32px grid was killing any attempt to have a natural looking terrain.\r      Factorio terrain 0.12 \r New technique: Instead of having only variations of 32px tiles, we produce a tileset with different sizes (x32, x64, x128, x256) in order to break this squary sense of grid, and even being able to render more detail in bigger sized tiles. So terrain looks much more natural. The visible tile-grid is almost gone, and we start spreading a new concept for us: the doodads. These are little sprites of plants and rocks randomly spread throughout the map in order to provide more variability and an organic feeling.\r     Factorio terrain 0.15 \r Things are getting better, the doodads were optimised and we're able to place much more of them, creating more interesting patterns and mixtures. It is also worth it to mention that the introduction of the high resolution graphics does a lot to help the look of the terrain.\r     Factorio terrain 0.16 \r After all those iterations, the next terrain generation integrates a couple of new concepts: the decals which are \"just\" doodads but ground-related. Decals are meant to generate terrain accidents and details without being oppressed by the rules of \"tileability\" and size. Basically decals are patches on top of a tileset that are very rich in detail. In combination with the doodads, the absence of the tile-grid and the high-res, we start to have a natural looking terrain. I have to add that the good and fast work of Ernestas, our environment artist, made possible the evolution of this new state of terrain. Now with our new techniques, the creation of a new tileset is very smooth.   Even with all the improvements, terrain still looks too flat, so another addition to 0.16 are the cliffs. Finally we can break the flatness of the Factorio surface, without having to change the mechanics of the game.  This new feature can add a bit to the fun of designing a factory by taking advantage of the topology of the map.  Or can lead combat to more interesting situations.   There are more additions to the terrain, and we will dedicate more time to this subject in future posts.

{"page_num": "19", "name": "Friday Facts #212 - The GUI update (Part 1)", "body": "A long time ago, in FFF-191 I wrote about improving the GUI. Well, things are finally starting to move, so this week I'll bring you an update on that. We even have a GUI team:  Twinsen(me): UX and programming Albert: UI, graphical design, layouts, mockups, UX Rseding91: main programming and GUI internals  The plan is to go through the entire game's GUI (including main menu, all entity GUIs and all game windows) and improve it both visually and interaction wise. This is quite a huge undertaking because:  Factorio's interactions are quite complex If you count all the entity windows and panels, we have about 120 windows to go through in the game. Mods can change many aspects of the game so we have to account for that to make sure windows still look good and are still easy to use: e.g. having 15+ recipe categories, having assembling machines with 20+ module slots, having recipes with 20+ ingredients, having players with 200+ inventory slots, etc. Many players are already used to interacting with the game in a specific way, so any major changes are hard to make. Our GUI back-end (heavily modified AGUI) is not exactly well written, programmer-friendly, or feature-rich. Many of the features and polishing we want to add were not done previously due to their programming complexity.  At the moment we are still early in the project, just defining the style and the concepts. During the next months, I'll try to make a series of FFF talking about the improvements we are making (starting with this one) so you can see how the project progresses, and offer feedback along the way.  Everything I mentioned in FFF-191 will be there, but we have even more cool improvements coming to the toolbar that we are working on, so today I'll talk about something else: the new train/locomotive GUI.  Disclaimers:\r  Everything you see are mockups made by Albert and are not from the game, but we will try to make it look almost identical in game. The style (colors and look) is not final. This is the 3rd iteration and Albert is still experimenting with making everything look nice. The purpose of these mockups are mostly to define the layout and interaction.  This is how the new Locomotive GUI will look. As you notice, apart from the style changes, they way the stations and conditions are shown is very different, but I'd say much more intuitive, informative, and easy to use.    Let's go through a short use case. You click add station and the list of stations appears. You can add a station by clicking on the station in the list or by clicking it in the small map. The map can be zoomed and moved around so you can easily find your station. Also, as you hover over stations in the list, the map will show their location.  The stations marked differently are unreachable from the train's current position. This way you can more easily recognize and possibly ignore stations outside of the current network.    Once you click a station, it is added to the schedule, along with a default condition. You can continue adding more stations, or add/edit the conditions for the new station.          Finally a schedule can look something like this. The path of the train will be shown. We will try to paint the path the train is taking at the moment, it will change as the train takes different paths.    The fuel can be accessed from the separate tab and the color of the locomotive can be changed using the color picker.\r The buttons in top of the map, from left to right are as follows:\r  Turn station names on or off. Change the angle of the station names. Switch to map view. Switch to camera view. Center view on the train. \r The small 'info' button you see on the right side will be a help button we will use throughout the game to help explain how different GUI work and when their elements mean. We will write more about this in some of the next parts of the FFF GUI update series.    We also want to add a neat tool for advanced players. Control-clicking on any point on the locomotive's map (or any station) will add a 'Temporary stop' to it's schedule. The train will try to go as close as it can to that point, wait a few seconds and finally automatically remove the 'Temporary stop' from it's schedule. This is very useful for quick transportation. It also allows you to quickly 'hijack' an existing train and use it to get somewhere, since the 'Temporary stop' will be deleted and the train's normal schedule will be resumed.  Another quality of life improvement will be a game option to automatically add some fuel from the player inventory when building vehicles (car, tank or locomotive), making rail transportation as simple as placing a locomotive on a rail, entering it and control-clicking where you want to go.  We hope you like the proposed changes. No doubt things will change as we implement and playtest these changes, but we thought it would be interesting to show you an early preview.  Finally the million dollar question is when will this be in game? Because it's quite a bit of work we already pushed the GUI update to 0.17. On the bright side, this mean 0.16 will come a bit sooner.  Let us know what you think by commenting in our usual topic at the forums.

{"page_num": "20", "name": "Friday Facts #203 - Logistic buffer chest", "body": "Further optimisations  I finished the item stack optimisations mentioned in FFF-198, and was able to do some performance tests. First I tested how many stacks on a big map actually need to use an externally allocated object (Item), and how many of them are plain. On the huge map I tested, it turned out that only 36K out of 1M stacks need the Item object. These were mainly science packs, as they need it for the progress of how used-up they are (and now when I think about it, it could also be omitted by only using the objects for science packs that are partially used up already). Overall factory performance was increased approximately 2% by this. It is nothing huge, but every bit matters.  One of the programmer that has read access to the code (Zulan), came up with a pull request that improves performance in Factorio by prefetching memory in the update loops ahead.  The problem when normally updating objects is, that CPU asks for memory representing the object. The memory is slow, at least compared to the CPU cache or the CPU speed. The memory transfer speed itself is not that slow, but the waiting (latency) time between ordering and receiving it is. This means, that what very often happens is, that CPU orders data of next entity from the memory, then it waits for quite a long time to get it, and then it does its logic. The memory prefetching partially solves it by doing this:\r  Order data of the next entity from memory (prefetch) Do the logic of the current entity in the meantime Go back to start \r The overall measured performance improvements vary between 9-12%, which is certainly a nice addition.

{"page_num": "22", "name": "Friday Facts #187 - Space science & 0.15 graphics", "body": "Space science  As you already know, in 0.15 we have reworked the science packs and added infinite science. More\r and different science packs make the game a lot more interesting. It reduces the complexity of\r blue science (which is great for newer players) while adding complexity later, and you now have\r to decide what to research first, especially with the more expensive game modes (which is\r interesting for advanced players), and infinite science adds something to do forever in the game.    However, one of my biggest complaints about Factorio always was that the rocket has no\r purpose, even though it is being propagated at all the points as the final step of the game. It is\r said at the trailer, at the introduction of freeplay, and by being the most advanced research,\r everything seems like it’s the thing to desire, but when I launched it for the first time and seeing\r the victory screen, I was feeling like \"And now what...\".  For me there is one main reason why Factorio is so awesome and why I can forget myself\r playing until 4 a.m., and that reason is the infinite loop of 'there is always a bottleneck', you\r always need to fix something, you have not enough power, or your production of a particular\r product is insufficient etc.    When you launch the rocket, you escape from this loop because it doesn’t lead anywhere. As\r we can see, we have learned to take the rocket as a measurable resource sink to quantify the\r size of our factories, which is great, but I think it makes sense to us only because we got used\r to it, not because it made sense in the first place, or at least it didn’t to me.  Now when 0.15 adds infinite research, I started to ask myself why would I launch the rocket at\r all, and I have seen many of you ask similar questions.  To compare the two, the infinite science is also quantifiable as I can see the amount I produced\r in the production screen, it also has an interesting crafting recipe (rocket parts vs. all science\r packs together), and it is also an infinite resource sink. The main difference is, the infinite\r research is actually useful.    This is where the space science comes into play. We now have a space science pack,\r obtained by launching a rocket. You get 1000 of these science packs per rocket, and every\r infinite research requires these science packs. Such a simple feature, but it closes the infinite\r game loop again. But of course in case you want to just launch rockets without worrying about\r science, you can still do that, just like previously.  We have also added more infinite researches, so now apart from worker robot speed, combat\r robot follower count and mining productivity bonus researches, we also have all of the\r combative damage upgrades infinite (not shooting speed as that would get ridiculous sooner or\r later), however their prices increase exponentially to prevent it from getting too extreme.    The rocket has to have a satellite in order to get the science packs (the rocket has to be able\r send back the discoveries, right?). The rocket silo now has an auto-launch checkbox so you can\r launch them automatically, and the launch is only going to happen when you insert satellite. So\r you can control the inserter with satellite to only launch rockets when you need the science\r packs automatically through circuit network.  Of course we also added support for mods, so you can define what do you get from sending a\r rocket, and depending on what you put in the rocket - say, if you put a tank into the rocket, you\r receive 100 raw fish, because that would make perfect sense.  We can build up on this concept in the future, but for now this already brings a lot of sense to\r the game as it is.    As a bonus, here is a album of my factory where I tested the infinite science concept.

{"page_num": "22", "name": "Friday Facts #180 - Map improvements", "body": "Public service announcement - Possible server breach and outages  In the past 7 days, our services (authentication, multiplayer matching, mod portal, etc.) experienced multiple outages. One of them was caused by one of our service providers and resulted in a roughly 6 hour long outage on Tuesday evening. This was a widespread outage all over the internet caused by problems with Amazon's AWS S3 and also affected other services, for example Instagram, Imgur or Trello.\r  \r The other 2 outages were the result of a possible security breach of one of our servers, acting as the master content server at the time. On Friday, just before midnight UTC, we were informed by Linode (our server provider), that a brute force SSH attack was originating from that server, targeting a specific IP in the OVH network. As a precaution, the server was cut from all network traffic, which caused a short outage. We haven't managed to determine, whether that attack was caused by a bug in some software or a runaway process, or if it was caused by someone who managed to gain access to the server. We can't say if it's possible to spoof the IP address of an attack of this kind and make it look like the attack is coming from someone else.\r  \r As a security measure, we have destroyed and redeployed all 3 content servers we currently operate, improved our firewall and automatic banning rules and invalidated passwords and SSH keys. All the releases that are available for download were checked and none of them were modified.\r  \r We apologise for any inconvenience we might've caused by these outages.\r   Additional map info \r The Trello card to improve our map has been sitting in our queue for a very long time, and since I wanted to program some low hanging fruit for 0.15, I decided to pick this. Let me present how far I got.\r  \r Now when I open the map view, it shows the map view settings mini-panel on the side (icons are temporary), which can be used to toggle different kind of additional info on the map.\r     The logistics area visualisation \r It wasn't really possible to see the roboport coverage in the scale of the whole factory and I missed that a lot, so it was the first thing to be done.\r     \r Now I can clearly see why did I get alerts of missing construction robots in the left part of the map. It can be also used to find all these small gaps in the coverage or off-by-one alignment issues.\r I'm also considering to show the roboport connections in this view, or as additional option.\r  The electric network visualisation \r This one might be especially useful when you want to find out the reason of electricity breach. As with the previous one, it gives even more incentive to build electric network in OCD friendly way, as all the circumstantial electric pole placements are more than visible in this view.\r     The pollution \r The pollution works the same as before, but it can be turned on and off the same way as other things. This means you'll no longer have to toggle the detailed info to see your base clearly through the pollution.\r  Map interaction \r This was the most obvious step of all. You can open locomotives and train stations from any distance, you can access them from the train manager, but you couldn't open them by clicking in the map. It is possible now.\r        Custom tags \r As the map shows train station names, people were actually using stations to put markers on the map. But as its kind of a hack, and it clutters the train destination selection dialog it needs a proper solution. This is why we have the custom tags now. It can be either text only, icon or both.\r  \r As you can see it can be used to mark different parts of the factory, it can be used in multiplayer to coordinate different kind of tasks and I don't doubt that people will use it to draw penises or other 'creative art' on the map as well.\r     Resource patch inspection \r Searching for the best patch around was quite tedious, as you had to walk to the locations and guess how much ore it contains by hovering over several ore patches. It is not needed anymore, as a player can just hover over the patch on the map to see how much it contains. As the area was discovered by radar, or by the player manually, there is no harm in providing this information. It also helps colorblind people as they couldn't distinguish the ore types by color so well.\r     Other improvements \r There are other things we are considering. Just to be sure, this doesn't mean a promise or a plan, just an idea, that might or might be not implemented:\r   Extend the custom tags, so they can refer to rectangular area. Interactive (clickable) electric and logistics networks that open the window with detailed info. Integrate the interaction into the train stop selection when adding new items to the train schedule Integrate the interaction into the train to allow semi-automatic one-time train order that wouldn't be limited to train stations. Be able to zoom from the map view directly to the world. Things not covered by radars would just be covered by some kind of blackness. Better map colors, more different colors for entities, so you would see whether it is an assembling machine, electric pole or turret. Option of Higher resolution of map. If we have 4 pixels per tile in the map it could be nicer and also provide more information when zoomed in Smarter map info. Especially in the high resolution option, the belts could theoretically remember the resource they are used for (if it is one purpose belt), and draw line of the color on them. Assembling machines could have a pixel(s) inside the square that would depend on the recipe.

One of the main reasons for this delay is us underestimating how long it would take to stabilize 0.14 and the new multiplayer code. We thought that because it was a relatively small 'major' release, that it would not take much time to make it stable. However the great community members playing the experimental version kept finding bugs for us to fix, and even now there are still several 0.14 bugs being identified and fixed in 0.15.  The extending bug fixing of 0.14 was no doubt necessary, but it has led us to be somewhat behind schedule on several features of 0.15.

{"page_num": "23", "name": "Friday Facts #175 - Programmable Speaker", "body": "The programmable speaker  There has always been some talk around the office about a music box that can be used to make simple sounds, you could even connect it to the circuit network and make simple songs. I put it on my long list of circuit network ideas, and in the past few week it has been coming to life.\r  \r So today I'll be talking about an exciting new entity coming in 0.15: the Programmable Speaker. It was designed to do two main things:\r  Show configurable GUI alerts and play audio alerts based on circuit conditions. Play audio samples as controlled by the circuit network in a way that simple songs can be created. \r The entity graphics are placeholder programmer graphics.\r     \r Let's start with the useful part, it's pretty straightforward. You set your circuit condition, set the sound you want it to make, set whether the sound should be heard in that part of the factory or across the entire map and add an optional GUI alert message. When the circuit condition is true, the speaker will play the selected sound and show the optional GUI alert. You can let the sound play continuously or use simple combinator logic to make the sound at custom intervals.     \r And now that fun part. We knew we wanted the Programmable Speaker to be able to make simple songs. Crazy ideas started to pour in, and it was quickly becoming a full-blown music production DAW with custom synthesizers and control over everything. But this has to be easily controlled by the circuit network without having to build real-time computers with combinators. So in the end I made the Programmable Speaker work as a step sequencer. If you send a circuit network signal pulse, an audio sample will start playing, otherwise nothing will happen. There is no control over the sample length or any special effects, but this means it is quite easy to control it using the circuit network.\r  \r Enough talk. Here is a demo of a song made using the samples already included. Everything you hear is created inside Factorio. I will leave it to you to analyze the video and figure out how the song is generated.\r     \r Modders can easily add more audio samples to the entity, including custom alerts. I imagine there will be a voice pack mod that could be programmed using combinators to speak things like \"Crude oil is low\".\r I'm sure the Programmable Speaker will be part of some very interesting posts on the Factorio Reddit.\r  \r There are some other circuit network improvements coming to 0.15, but I will talk more about them in some other FFF.\r  The map download struggle (Technical) \r For as long as I can remember, our multiplayer map downloader had (among other problems) the problem that it would get stuck at 100%. It was an extremely rare problem some random person would report. We would keep ignoring the bug throwing it in \"Pending\" or \"Duplicates\" or \"1/0 Magic\", but after a few months some other person would report it again. I seem to have a habit of obsessing over these rare \"unfixable\" bugs (audio mixer crashing, vsync performance issues, non-pixel-perfect sprite drawing), so I started looking into this map downloader issue.\r  \r First I was looking at the map downloader code itself, thinking surely there is something wrong there. This was a long process because I had no way of reproducing the issue, so it usually involved going back and forth with a person who was experiencing the issue. I would create an executable that would create detailed logs, that person would run the game using that, I would investigate the logs and see that our map downloader works correctly. The I would add more logging and so on. By the time I would reach some kind of conclusion that person would stop answering and probably stop playing Factorio.\r  \r But near the end thanks to some helpful players, I was able to see what was happening. Looking at the wireshark capture for both the client and the server, it seems that a packet with a specific content or a specific checksum always gets filtered. Some cheeky firewall from the computer, router or ISP is looking inside the packet data and blocking the packets it does not like. No matter how many times I resend that packet, it never gets through, while all the other hundreds of thousands of game and map packets have no problem getting through. Correct me if I'm wrong, but something like this should not be happening. You can read all the details and see the packet data last posts of the forum topic.\r  \r The issue seems to be resolved if I add one byte of random data to the packet, but I would like to know why is this happening in the first place. If you know what is happening or you know someone that might, please don't hesitate to enlighten us :)\r \r This shows how hard it is to make software that \"just works\" for everyone. There will always be that 0.1% of people who end up having problems that no one could have ever foreseen.\r Big thanks to admalledd, dadymax, Rippie and the other forum members who helped or are still helping me investigate this odd issue.\r  \r In other good news, while Rseding91 was also looking at the map download code trying to investigate this problem, he found we had some slow code doing hard drive seeking, slowing down map uploads. He improved it and you should see better map transfer speeds on LAN and high speed connections.\r  \r As usual, let us know what you think at the forums.

{"page_num": "23", "name": "Friday Facts #172 - Blending and Rendering", "body": "Alpha blending and pre-multiplied alpha From time to time there is some confusion inside the team about how sprites are blended with the background when rendering, and what kind of effects we are able to achieve by tinting the sprites. So I (Posila) have decided to write up a few paragraphs about how alpha blending works (not only in Factorio), and what it means when someone talks about pre-multiplied alpha.    When the GPU is figuring out what color it should draw on a particular pixel position, it runs a blending operation on just the computed pixel color and original color in the render target. There are several common blending operation modes (additive, multiplicative, overwrite, etc.), but the most common one used in Factorio is alpha blending. It calculates the resulting color using following equation (usually the new color is called 'source' and the background color that is being overwritten is called 'destination'):  You can easily see that a source with alpha 0 will be fully transparent and the one with alpha 1 will be fully opaque.    In games it is common to use a pre-multiplied alpha, which means the color channels of textures are stored in memory being already pre-multiplied by the alpha channel. Alpha blending with pre-multiplied alpha uses a simplified equation:  Besides a slight performance gain from the GPU not having to do bunch of multiplication all the time, this equation allow us to do some extra effects we couldn't do without pre-multiplied alpha.    Factorio renders sprites as colored polygons with texture. We usually refer to the color of a polygon as the 'tint', and every pixel of a sprite is multiplied with its tint. This is useful mainly for color masks, for example the diesel locomotive has a grayscale color mask which is tinted by the color it has set. Tints should have a pre-multiplied alpha too, but they don't have to, so we can use it to lie about the colors and alpha to the GPU. For example if we use tint {r=1,g=1,b=1,a=0} we can simplify previous equation even further and we get additive blending:  This is great because that means we can switch between alpha and additive blending without having to change the blending state in graphics API, which would break sprite batching and result in an increase in the CPU cost of rendering.    For some effects we use a tint with alpha between 0 and 1 heavily. This makes the result appear to be a combination of additive and alpha blending. For example, fire would eventually blend into a single solid color with pure additive blending, or would not look like it is emitting light with pure alpha blending. By using tint (1, 1, 1, 0.35) on the flame sprites, the brightness of overlapping flames adds up partially, but the flames don't completely lose their details. The same trick is used for smoke.  Textures with pre-multiplied alpha also produce better results in texture filtering , which is probably the main reason why they are so widely used in the videogame industry.

{"page_num": "23", "name": "Friday Facts #169 - Combat revisit 2", "body": "Combat Balance  Twinsen here. As you might have read in Friday Facts #166, we wanted to do some combat balancing. First, to not bring the hopes of everyone up too much, this did not mean a combat overhaul. It means mostly tweaking numbers to make the game more fun and make some of the the weapons more viable. No new entities or new mechanics.  As I was doing the combat balance, it was clear the everyone has their own different opinion of how combat is, how it should be and how to make it \"better\". It's hard to please everyone, especially when you are just tweaking numbers.\r \r To try to objectively evaluate combat I used the following methodology. As the game progresses, the player's power increases through research, but so do the biters(mainly due to evolution factor).\r \r So I split the game in 7 sections based on research progress. Each section also has the evolution factor I tested biters will approximately have in an average game.  Initial - 0 evolution Red - 0.1 evolution Red+Green - 0.3 evolution Red+Green+Military - 0.4 evolution Red+Green+Blue+Military - 0.7 evolution Red+Green+Blue+Military+High Tech - 0.9 evolution Red+Green+Blue+Military+High Tech+Production - 0.99 evolution  Then for each section I tested both offensive combat and defensive combat using the available guns and turrets and tweaked the numbers accordingly. While tweaking the numbers, I keep this in mind (this is not a complete list):  Fun always wins: I prefer changes that are more fun and less annoying even if it means it could be slightly unbalanced. New weapons should be slightly more powerful than old weapons, to incentivize you to experiment. So near the end game, a rocket launcher will be better than the machine gun. Destroying biter bases is hard in the beginning and significantly easier toward the end game, to give the sense of combat power progression. Defending is not too hard in the beginning. I try not to put a new player in the situation of \"you didn't prepare properly, you have to start a new game, because no matter what you do you will get killed\". Then throughout the game you have to upgrade your defenses as the biters evolve.  So far, the changelog looks like this. There are many numbers that were tweaked and are not included in this list.  Player regains health at a much higher rate, but only after being out of combat for 10 seconds. Discharge defense equipment pushes back, stuns and damages nearby enemies when activated by the remote. Decreased the size of Discharge defense equipment from 3x3 to 2x2. Greatly increased the damage of Personal Laser Defense Equipment. Flamthrower gun has a minimum range of 3. The flames created on ground from the flamethrower significantly increase in duration and damage when more fuel is added to them by firing at the same spot. Increased fire resistance of biter bases. Increased the health of player non-combat buildings. Increased player health from 100 to 250. Increased collected amount and effectiveness of Raw Fish. Increased the damage, range and health of biters worms. Decreased health and resistance of Behemoth biters. Doubled the stack size of all ammos. Tweaked the cost and crafting time of some ammos. Increased the damage of most player ammos. Greatly increased the damage and fire rate of Rockets and Cannon Shells. Increased the collision box of Cannon Shells. Increased Tank health and resistances. Added research for Tank Cannon Shells damage and shooting speed. Tweaked research bonuses and added more end-game research for military upgrades. Greatly increased the damage of Mines. They also stun nearby enemies when they explode. Biters stop following player after 10 sec of not giving or receiving damage if the player is more than 50 tiles away. Other minor changes.  As usual, these changes are not final and will probably change to some degree as we playtest more.\r \r There are still many things to be done. We are always talking about more end-game weapons, so don't worry, the combat in the late-game will be even more worry-free.  There is also one thing that we always talked about trying to remove: turret-creep (destroying biters base building turrets closer and closer). This method is very powerful and usually doesn't cost anything. So far I believe that we did not find a simple, fun and fair solution. Ideas include: large power-up times(annoying and also weakens base defense); simply not allowing turrets to be build near biter bases (makes the player feel cheated); underground anti-turret worms (sugar-coated version of the previous idea). With the combat changes that were done I believe there is almost always an option to destroy bases without being forced to use turret-creep.In the end maybe your ingenuity and effort of  building all those electric poles should be rewarded; If the player wants to do it that way, why not let him?

{"page_num": "24", "name": "Friday Facts #168 - Nightvision Nightmare", "body": "Nightvision nightmare  As Twinsen continues tweaking the combat, he started to complain about the “green fog” effect that is applied during night when the player’s character has nightvision goggles equipped. Nightvison in 0.14 works in a way that it reduces the darkness of night, and then draws a transparent green overlay. This washes out the colors, reduces contrast, and makes the picture pretty unpleasant to look at.    The first idea was to just make the green overlay be rendered around light sources, to reward players who put lights into their bases, by not making the base look worse with nightvision on. This didn’t look too good, and as we were trying to figure out how to improve it, other developers, especially artists, caught on to what we were doing, and started to provide their own ideas.  Next we tried to darken only the red and blue channels when nightvision is on. This will make the picture green without losing contrast and we can drop the green overlay. We kept “not applying effect onto lighted area” logic and it started to look interesting.    Albert wasn’t happy with the result though, so we continued experimenting. We added a soft green tint to lighted areas, and a bright green glow onto the transition between light and darkness. Then we added white highlights to light sources and it finally started to pleasant to look at.    We will stick with this version for time being, but plan to work on it more. We can’t agree if this change is for better or worse even inside the team. It seems everybody has their own idea about how nightvision effect should look like and what benefits it should provide to players. For example it would be nice to have goggles with greyscale effect that would highlight biters. So maybe heat vision?

{"page_num": "28", "name": "Friday Facts #127 - Steam Status III: Thank You", "body": "Hi all, what a week. Let's see what has happened.   The Launch Week   The game launch at Steam has obviously been a highlight of the week (well not just the week=)). However quite a few other \"launches\" have happened as well. As for the game, together with Steam launch we have launched the game at Humble Store. Based on how this goes we might add a few other popular retail sites (i.e. GOG, Green Man Gaming). Prior to the appearance of the Game on Steam, we came up with the 0.12.24 (imho a magical release number) which fixed a couple of last minute bugs. This is the version available at Steam.   Outside of the digital world, there have been quite some news as well. Kovarex's son Robin has been born on Monday early in the morning. As Kovarex reported, the whole process went quite smoothly and fast. The family is back at home from hospital already. And finally, a baby girl called Ema has been born to our artist Vaclav. This has happened some time ago already, however there were quite a few complications and only this week Vaclav has returned to the office. All is fine by now as well with his family. We were thinking of posting some pictures of the babies, but as kovarex rightly noted \"All babies look the same\". So there is not much point=)   Gameplay Trailer   You have probably noticed the homepage layout has been changed. This is due to the release of our new Gameplay trailer. The Factorio Trailer is focused on giving an impression of the game. Without giving too much explanations of what is going on. Basically it goes for the WOW EFFECT. With the Gameplay Trailer our goal was to introduce the real aspects of the game to new players in a short video (well still keeping a bit of a wow effect=)). Show how the game actually looks, how player progresses in the game, how some common UI work, etc. Albert, Robert and others have poured many, many hours to the video. From the comments on Youtube it seems that it was more than worth it.   Thank you   Yesterday was pretty intense. Fixing last minute issues at our website, tweaking the Steam page, finishing the Factorio guide (see below), putting everything together, etc. Finally at 8 p.m. we have semi-automatically launched the game. Huge relief has replaced the frantic preparations. Everybody, except for Albert who went for vacation, was in the office. There was a bit of champaign and positive atmosphere. This got even stronger after a while when positive reviews started to pour in, Steam in-game counter kept going up and discussion at Steam page kicked off. Months of preparation culminated during that evening.      After the launch we just relaxed and basically watched what was happening. And it was great to see the communnity engage so actively in promoting the game. So it feels more than appropriate to use this section for a big THANK YOU to you guys for all the support. It is difficult to capture everything, but I will try to list the imho most important stuff (I am a methodical type after all=)). So thank you, especially for:   Awesome reviews. At this moment there are 630 reviews with rating of 99%. There is literally 2 \"not recommended\" reviews. That is mind blowing. Makes it a challenge to stay \"with our feet on the ground\"=)   Support at reddit. The new Factorio Gameplay Trailer link has stayed at the top of r/Games for nearly full day. Heck, it seems that we have received as much exposure as highly anticipated Superhot.   Spreading the word to your friends, youtubers, etc.   Helping out new users at Steam discussions, Reddit, our forums etc.        Factorio guide   In one of the previous releases of FFF, we have mentioned a new third party documentation project called Factorio Strategy Guide. There has been some more development regarding this one. The result is that we (Wube Software) have bought the guide from the original author (Xterminator). We have turned the original .pdf document into a free online guide. Albert has spent his last \"finishing\" hours, before going for a well-deserved vacation, polishing this online document. This is linked from the Steam page as well. The guide should be considered to be very much a work in progress. There are many things that we plan to improve - phrasing, screenshots, general consistency. However we feel it could be of a good value for new players in the current state. That is why we pushed to have it ready for Steam release. There is a chance of integrating this one with Wiki in the future for instance. However at the moment this feels like the most comprehensive introductory resource into the game there is (apart from messing with the game yourself).   Lua API documentation   There has been one more update in the documentation. This time aimed at the modders community. The Lua API documentation at the wiki has always been a bit messy, not properly updated and often confusing. Couple of weeks ago, Oxyd and Rseding have finished a resolute mini project of making the Lua API documentation autogenerate from the source code. So basically the function bindings in the code are annotated with special-formatted comments (imagine something like java Doxygen) and based on this a comprehensive reference is then generated. You can checkout the result at the  Lua API doc page. We will link this website from some appropriate place soon. Another great advantage of this approach is that we can keep clear separation of documentation for different versions. The only drawback is that the feedback for the documentation is now more cumbersome. If you find something that could be improved, sending us an email is probably the best option at the moment. We might make a new topic for this in the modding subforum if necessary.   Funny Stats   Last couple of days and hours before the Steam release there has been an escalation of sales at our webpage. That was to be expected - people were taking advantage of cheaper price before Steam launch. It was also expected for sales to drop after the release. Still it is rather funny to watch the hourly sales stats from yesterday.      Life goes on   So this is it. A hectic week is over. The game is launched and it seems to be doing really well. Let's see how it goes=) I have a feeling that our support department (Scott=)) has some rought times ahead. Anyway, Monday seems like a good opportunity to \"get back down to Earth\" and continue in the 0.13 development, which has suffered a bit in the past two weeks.   As usual you can post your comment at our forums. ", "url": "/blog/post/fff-127", "img": "https://factorio.com/static/img/factorio-banner-main.jpg", "author": "Tomas", "date": "2016-02-26"},

{"page_num": "28", "name": "Friday Facts #126 - Steam Status II and Trains Stuff", "body": "Hello, so here we go with the last Friday Facts before the big day next Thursday.   0.12.23   The 0.12.23 is getting latest tweaks regarding the integration of Steam functionality for sharing saves for one account across different locations (different computers). In the meantime the majority of the dev team has been playtesting the game for past couple of days (and doing the usual \"factory building shouting\" across the office). Hopefully it will be out in the beginning of the next week.   Steam page   So the Steam page is up and running. We have uploaded the 0.12.22 and that (together with the page content) has been approved by the Steam review. The game is now listed in coming soon section. Things to check out:    Updated existing trailer. The new gameplay trailer is hidden and will appear together with the game release (just to keep the expectations=)).   New Factorio cover image (Albert is really proud of this one=)).   A bunch of selected screenshots.   As usual, we are open to ideas and recommendations in the comments on the forum=).    Other Steam Stuff    There is now a Steam FAQ page on the Factorio subreddit which contains a lot of useful information regarding the Steam release.   We have had a betting round in the office what will the Factorio review percentage be in 1 week and 1 month after the EA release (so 2 numbers, i.e. [90, 86]). You are welcome to give your bets in the comments.   We took down the Furnace Attendant tier from our webpage. The Mining Drill Operator is still available, because it adds stuff (name in the game, gfx wiki access) which will not be available after Steam release.   There has been some discomfort on the forums about people overpaying on the Furnace Attendant tier (because Scenario Pack will be given for free alongside the basic game). We don't percieve this as an unfair treatment on our side. Still, we are thinking about ways how to provide some additional value / recognition to people who supported us by buying the higher tiers.   In the middle of the finishing gfx craziness, Albert has spontaneously stopped shaving his beard. This has been going for long enough time to catch attention. I found the \"idea\" somehow compelling and joined him not so long ago. Though not impressive beards they are quite unusual for us. We might make a picture next Thursday=)   There is still a possibility of Factorio release day coinciding with Kovarex's baby being born.    New trains overview screen   One of the new features in the 0.13 will be a new screen for viewing all the trains in the game. This one is invoked from the mini side menu mentioned in  one of previous FFF. The screen basically shows every train depicted as a minimap and a train schedule below it. Trains will be ordered lexicographically based on the first station (also lexicographically) in their schedules (this should be the \"expected\" ordering - see trains sharing the stations close to each other). Schedules give hint about current station and whether the train is on the way / waiting in the station / in manual mode or without path. Also there is a search field which narrows the listing based on the stations in the schedule. Below is an example of the trains overview.      Updated train screen   We made some more updates to the existing single train screen. Namely adding the \"open ttd\" inspired preview of the train. There is a switchable \"camera view\" and \"map view\". Both are zoomable by scrolling the preview. Check out below how it looks in the game.   We are also thinking about using this embedded minimap / camera views in other parts of the game. One straightforward example would be to have a camera entity (it could also be just existing radar entity). Then there would be a screen pretty much like the trains overview screen showing all the cameras and you could quickly check what is happening in different parts of the factory without physically going there. Or maybe another approach would be to allow player (with a special object in his armor?) view real-time any part of the map covered by radars.

{"page_num": "28", "name": "Friday Facts #124 - Steam Status I", "body": "Hi there, the Steam date is looming and we haven't been sitting with the hands in our lap just waiting. So here comes a report of what is going on and what will change with the Steam release on 25th of Feb 2016.   The Price   We have decided that the Steam release is a good opportunity to adjust the price of the game. The referential game price will be set to 20€ / 20$ (well 19.95$ because that is how Steam rolls). Steam has a feature of providing different pricing in different countries and we will probably follow their recommended pricing in this regard. Which means that in countries with generally lower purchasing power the game might be cheaper than that. The game price at the webpage will be set to 20€ as well to match the Steam referential price.   There are couple of reasons for increasing the price. But the most important ones are:   We feel the game is closing a stable and feature rich state that justifies such a price (judging by other games in the market).   Scenario pack will become part of the basegame which adds more content (see details below).  Naturally Steam will take their share from every copy sold for distributing the game (however this is expected to be more than offset by the amount of potential new players).   We need $$$ for world domination=) And besides houses in the Hawaii have become more expensive lately ...     So the bottom line is: if you have a friend who is still hesitant about buying the game now and the price difference would matter to him / her, let him / her know =)   The Keys   Every user who has bought some version of our membership will have a possibility to get a Steam key for the game. This will most probably be implemented via an interface at our website. What I have in mind is a simple form in the User profile page which will assign a Steam key upon request (clicking the request button=)). This functionality is not yet programmed but it will be done very soon and available together with the Steam launch. Steam doesn't have a web api to generate Steam keys, but we will prefetch a (hopefully) substantial amount of those and then assign them to users automatically from this batch.   Our current approach is that the player's account at the website will co-exist with the Steam account (if requested). That means that player can download the game from our webpage or via the Steam. His / her choice. This is provided as a convenience for the existing players and the generated Steam keys are not meant to be distributed / given / sold to other people. We will put a clause about this into Terms & Conditions. In case that a significant portion of Steam keys would be given away / sold to other people then we reserve the right to alter the approach. One option would be that the game would be available via Steam or via our webpage but not both. Hopefully that won't be necessary=).   We haven't made a decision yet, whether unpaid memberships will be able to get the steam key as well. This includes memberships given out for free in promotions (i.e. over the Youtube, Twitch) and testing in the early stages of development. If you are unsure what your membership is, you can check it out at your  profile page when logged in.   The Scenario Pack   Starting with the game release on Steam, the Scenario Pack will be distributed together with the basic game itself. This is quite a big change=) Our motivations are following:   We believe that Scenario pack contains some really interesting content that gives prominence to different aspects of the game than the Campaign and the Freeplay. Exposing this to wider audience feels right.   Having the Scenario Pack in the base package (and not as a paid content) takes away some pressure for updating it. Though we still have ideas for additional scenarios / mini campaigns.   Adding the Scenario Pack gives more justification to increased price.     The Tiers & The Content   There will be no tiers on Steam. There will simply be one package with the game itself, which will also include the content of the scenario pack. The wallpapers will be made public for download. The 0.12 features a new soundtrack. We plan to make this available for purchase as a standalone DLC. This is meant for users who want to support us and our music composer beyond the scope of the game. This is probably all there will be available to begin with. We might add a possibility to get the name in the game as DLC in the future, but that is not decided yet.   On our webpage the tiers will be reduced to Transport Belt Repair Man (might lose the fancy name and become just \"The Package\"). This will be the game itself with the content of the scenario pack (same as on Steam). It is not clear yet if we sell the soundtrack as DLC on our webpage as well.   These changes come partly from the incentive to have the same content available on the Steam as on our webpage. Also there has been little attention from our side to update the content in the Furnace Attendant and Mining Drill Operator tiers. For instance the wallpapers or the graphical handbook are ridiculously outdated. We really appreciate players who have supported us by purchasing these tiers, however we feel that most of that additional content has become obsolete and it is time for a goodbye or reintegration to the basic game (as in case of scenario pack).  The Marketing  Scott has moved to Prague and has been working with us in our office since the beginning of this week. He has been spending most of his time reaching out to youtubers / streamers / bloggers and other potential marketing sources. Basically we are trying to prepare a sort of a \"general public hit\" alongside the Steam release. Even though we are directly \"pushing the game out there\" we would still appreciate the help from you guys, the community. We will be sending out a \"call to arms\" email when the game has launched officially notifying existing players that the game is now available on Steam. When the game has launched, it would be great to see existing players come over to leave a review, help out new players from Steam or invite their friends to join them for a game of Multiplayer. However if there is something you feel you could do to help promote the game even before it launches on Steam (i.e. recommending it to your favorite youtuber) that would be of a great help too.  The Trailers  As announced earlier, to celebrate the Steam launch we have decided to make another trailer. This new trailer (we call it Trailer 3 or Gameplay Trailer) is a collection of mostly real scenes from the game giving the taste of how the game is actually played. After heroic effort coming mostly from Albert, this has been finished by now. It will be made public on the launch. Something for you guys to look forward=)   The current trailer has been visually (and a bit in terms of content as well) improved and will also be made public with the game launch. We call this one Trailer 2 or the Teaser, because it gives a taste of what the game is about.   And to add a bit of nostalgy, do many of you still remember the very first trailer (Trailer 1) which we made for the Indiegogo campaign? It was made in less than a week and then re-made within a few hours before the launch of the crowdfunding campaign (which happend at 8 a.m. after a sleepless night). Some of the phrases (voiceovered by a polish narrator) became kind of memes at a time (i.e. \"fix fings\"). Oh boy, that feels like in another life=)  The Bonus Screen  So to compensate for the wall of text below is a screenshot of one of the upcoming features in the 0.13. We have added a little side gui that will provide clickable shortcuts for couple of existing windows (i.e. Main Menu, Production Statistics) and couple of new windows. One of them is the Bonus Screen. This shows what Bonuses has the player researched / obtained. This is quite useful information which was not avaiable until now. Next week will be more focused on new features we are working for in 0.13. And it is imho quite interesting stuff, so stay tuned.      To keep up with the tradition, if there is anything you would like us to know, join the discussion at the forums.

{"page_num": "30", "name": "Friday Facts #107 - The Wedding", "body": "Hi everyone,  another week filled with bug fixing, technology sprites work and general small issues, has passed. Our internal wish to get the 0.12 stable before 0.12.10 release just flew by laughing merrily. But that will not stop us. Step by step we continue=)    The Wedding    The title says it all. Tomorrow is Kovarex's wedding day. The ceremony is going to take place in the countryside and we will stay at the venue till the next morning - afterparty, playing board games and stuff=). Kovarex is already at the spot doing some preparations but if there is a message you would like to leave him, you can use the comment thread  on the forums .   No Greenlight    So there will be no Steam Greenlight. We were in touch with one of the Valve employees and they made us an offer to enter Steam directly without going through the Greenlight process. This is something that we will gladly do because that means less things to worry about (we have quite some of that already).     Speaking about Steam. We have drawn quite good inspiration from community forum discussions following past Friday Facts episodes. Namely the ones regarding  when to enter Steam  and how to  promote the game . So as for entering the Steam, we have settled to aim for January 2016. As usual this is a plan and plans can change (especially when it comes to Factorio release announcements=)).    Gameplay preview   Regarding game promotion, we have decided to give it a shot and create a gameplay footage / preview video. Basically it would be a short (less than 2 minutes) video that shows basic game mechanics and how the game is played. If the trailer gives a taste of Factorio (and it is a first video we expect potential player to see) this gameplay preview should be the 2nd video and it will give him a \"glimpse on the menu\". At the moment we are in the planning stage but we will make sure to keep you up updated.     Also we are getting in touch with some professional (Indie) game promoters to see if we could work together and give more shine to Factorio Steam release. If you have more recommendations regarding our planned Steam launch please share them (ideally on the forums). It is a great source of inspiration for us.    Community spotlight   I would like to start a new section here in the Friday Facts when we ocasionally introduce interesting content from the community. The thing is that the Factorio community-generated content (mods, youtube videos, tools, suggestions and tutorials) is getting quite big and it might be of a good value to people who are not up to date with what is happening. It will of course be biased by our preference=) So here we go.   For today I would like to mention an interesting video series made by Negative Root. Negative Root is very active Youtuber with quite some Factorio content. What I especially like is the variety in the content he produces. He has an extensive  tutorial series (also higly recommended), break the game series, couple of regular Lets plays etc. The one I have chosen for today is his Factorio Fixit series.   So the idea is that Root Negative \"visits\" other people's factories, inspects them, improves them and also gives ideas on how to do things more efficiently. And this whole process is recorded. Something like Factorio public consulting. Root Negative has played the game a lot (a LOT). So he has quite some experience to share (judging from the videos much more than me for instance :D). Making a series like this gives a great value for the person who made that factory as well as for general audience who is interested in improving their factory building skills. The series has been running for a long time so there is plenty of \"study material\" there. Below is a recent episode where he is dealing with building blue science setup.      Team update   On monday, Vaclav has reinforced our GFX team as we have announced in the past. So we are now 10 people sitting at the office. Actually, yesterday we went to take a few photos of the team. The team page update is coming soon. Stay tuned.   That is it for today. The commenting thread is  where you expect it .

Fortunately there are the Friday Facts to put myself together and retrace the events=))    The Grey Zone   At the moment we are kind of in a grey zone. The 0.12 bugs are more or less solved (though there is still some \"popping up\" of new issues) and the full speed work on 0.13 hasn't started yet (actually not even slow speed work has started). We are finishing with little (often technical debt) tasks from our internal lists. There is just ton of issues like: fixing locale fonts, updating tips and tricks, writing tests for compilcated existing functionality, tweaking our automatic deployment and testing setup, auto-generating the Lua API documentation, fixing sound glitches, etc. The list goes on.  One of the tasks has been related to our headless binary. This is the binary to run on linux servers without graphics card. This is now available in the downloads section alongside other releases. There is a small convenience difference where by clicking the download, the resulting download link (from one of our cdn servers) is valid for 10 minutes (instead of regular 10 seconds) so the server owner can conveniently copy this url and download the game directly from the server. In the future we plan to have the updater work for headless servers as well so that will make things even more convenient.  The good news is that the list of these little tasks is getting shorter. Also we have already more or less agreed on distribution of big tasks for the 0.13. These have been discussed in the past and are also visible at our roadmap. Some work on these should start already next week.

If a reasonable price tag on a great mod allows the creator to develop the mod full time, create professional content, and people are willing to pay for it, everyone wins. Free mods would still exist so it would be up to the players to choose. I'm NOT saying we are going to allow paid mods for Factorio anytime soon.

{"page_num": "37", "name": "Friday Facts #32 - The New Trailer", "body": "Hello everyone,  so it is kind of obvious what the main topic of today's post will be. After months of waiting, the new trailer went public on Thursday (on time - YAY). Michal and Albert were working till like 5 a.m. to finish all the super final details, record the trailer and post it on youtube. Still we were unsure about the final result. The quality of the video is unsatisfactory compared to the original (Youtube recompresses the video) and we keep seeing more and more tiny little errors in the trailer - things like bad timing of honking when the train leaves the sorter, too close zooming now and there, one of the biters being rendered \"inside the worm\", clash sound on the bridge played a bit too early. So we monitored the reactions rather anxiously.  And we were overwhelmed. Positively. The trailer video got over 10k views the same day with couple of hundreds likes and many, many positive and encouraging comments. On top of that the trailer was posted on Reddit in r/Games and it got quite a bit of traction there as well. We received lots of great emails, tweets and the sales spiked significantly. And the cherry-pick is that today we got emails from guys at Gamasutra and PC Gamer UK who were interested in getting a copy of the game for potential articles / previews on these sites. So looks like the new trailer is doing its job:)  Big thank you to all of you who contributed to this  (by giving advice on trailer concept, spreading the word, liking, tweeting, etc.).  Maybe a little bit in the shadows of the new trailer comes the new Factorio logo (you can see it in the trailer as well as on the website). Quite a while ago we made a post which introduced our new logo prototype. This post was followed by a fruitful discussion on the forums. We took the major points from those discussions and put them into the new logo. That means we (and by \"we\" I mean Albert:)) fixed the shape a bit, added a more fitting texture and finally got a better ending wheel. We are really happy about the result. The old logo is gone long live the new one:) (we will update the wiki and forums soon ...).  By the end of the next week we will finish with some more \"marketing / PR karma\" steps. Things like:  Direct debit card payments. Don't have a Paypal account? No worries, you will be able to buy the game with a single \"swipe\" of your card.  Up to date screenshots with latest graphics (it is a pain to see new articles about Factorio popping up with half a year old screenshots).  New css template for the forums (including the new logo). Further web polish - adding links to couple of good youtube preview videos about Factorio, maybe adding some logo resources for people to use when previewing the game, etc.  This will finally bring us to the state when we will be positive about trying to reach to the wider audience.  Oh yeah and apart from refreshing the youtube trailer page and scraping internet for feedback on the trailer we did some \"regular work\" as well. Namely for the multiplayer. The basics of synchronization layer, connection management and data transfers are in place. They haven't yet been tested together though - we are too afraid the whole thing will just explode - so for now we are writing tests for these like crazy. The next in line are lobby (to actually get players together and start / join the game) and changing the core game to properly deal with multiple players. After this we will hopefully start with some very early tests here over LAN. We will keep you up to date;)  I guess you all noticed, but there is a new steam engine graphics in the trailer. Albert said that we can't release the trailer with the old one so we listened. And it was imho a good decision.

{"page_num": "37", "name": "Friday Facts #31 - Factorio is going places", "body": "Hello,  as mentioned in the last update the word about Factorio started to spread much faster than we were used to. We are happy about that and we would like to thank to all the people who helped to spread the word. We have been contacted by several youtubers, and told all of them to wait for the release of their videos until the 1st of May so there is a good chance that we didn't even reach the peak so far. The reason why we want to wait for the 1st may is because it is the release date of our new trailer, we were ready to send Albert home to see his wife already, but his perfectionism didn't let him as he decided to remake the last entity for the trailer, the steam generator. It is already remodelled now, waiting to be retextured, so we are almost finished.  Most of the work now is still related to the multiplayer. I keep fixing one desynchronisation bug a day, so I'm near to being able to replay the demo campaign. We are discussing the details of networking almost daily and it seems like our second model of network synchronisation is going to be more consistent than the first one. I hope that the Factorio dev proverb (The third version is usually good) will not apply to this.  In the meantime, I started to do a little research of the problem with the growing video memory requirements. It is going to be more relevant in the future if we want to add different enemies or machines, so anyone who knows about game programming could give us a hint.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Busy weekend", "body": "Hi all,  this weekend has been very busy. For our sales counter. On Saturday, quill18 made a nice youtube preview of Factorio. The video has been seen by a few thousands of people. The reaction to video was very positive and shortly after it was released, the sales counter went crazy. In the evening the game has already made more money for the day than for the whole month a year ago.  There was a glitch in the evening, when we breached an outgoing limit on the number of emails the web site can send out. The result was that people could buy the game, but wouldn't get an activation email. Not the best timing, especially considering that I was out of the house. Anyway, we have resolved the problem in a timely manner and sent the codes to people who didn't get them automatically (sorry for troubles again if you were one of them). The rest of the extended weekend was rather smooth. Today we even went past the magical (for us) threshold of 10k sales. I still remember the time when we were starting with Factorio and plannig that if we can make 10k sales within a year it will be a success. It took much longer, but the prospects are bright. The feedback we got, from the people seeing the latest version of the game (the video was done with 0.9.8) for the first time was very positive.  Allright, that is enough for the small happy rant about Factorio getting some traction. If you have something to say please do so on our forums.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #30 - Full time on MP", "body": "Hello,  after a long long time the 0.9.8 was marked stable this week. There were no big ovations or cheering, just a quite \"stable sticker exchange\":) The bugs forum is not empty though, as someone would expect. Quite a few small issues remain, but for the sake of moving on we decided to put them to our backlog and mark the release as stable. However if some game crashing or very serious bugs are discovered in 0.9.8, we will make a hotfix. Oh, and the good thing is that we managed to break the streak (for now) of ever increasing number of bugfix releases (the 0.9 had 8 bugfix releases - the same as 0.8).  The whole \"programming department\" has been fully commited to the work on multiplayer for a while now. The task divison for now is following:   Michal - fully deterministic simulation. This is an absolute must, because all multiplayer peers will calculate the simulation themselves and only the player input (we call it input actions) will be exchanged over the network. Nice effect of having deterministic simulation will be having functional replays again (hmmm not really again because there have always been some bugs in them even when they were \"working\":)).   Kuba - lower level network layer. This includes the connection management, packets management (we will be using UDP for all the communication) and eventually things like NAT punching to allow connections for peers behind NAT (few people have public IP address).  Tomas - synchronization layer. This logic will take care of keeping the simulation state same for all the players in the game. This includes queing up the input actions, sending them out in batches (tick closures to other peers), requesting missing tick closures, etc.   These things are absolute minimum necessary for our multiplayer implementation. However there is more to be done after this, things like: starting the game (the lobby), mechanism for a player joining already existing game, hiding the latency for the player (most of the time the actions for different players will not collide so we can act as if common actions - like moving the player around - were confirmed immediately) and more (see our battleplan whiteboard in one of the previous friday facts). There is a lot of work ahead, but the good news is that we have finally fully dived into it. We will keep you updated about the progress:)  Albert has finished with most of the map trailer tweaks. Today we also did a first test with exporting the trailer using the new screenshot mechanism. We did this on Michal's computer which is way more powerful than mine (it does take a while to export 3600 screenshots). However there was this funky bug that parts of the terrain in the screenshots had strange, kind of inverted, colors. We have spent like half a day looking into this issue. Finally it turned out to be a problem in our custom optimized version of d3d drawing routine (this was happening on windows only). Spending hours in frustration hunting bugs (that are not even visible to the player in the end) happens more often than you would think, so game programming is not just about sitting back, playing video games and calling it \"research\" (but that is part of the job too:)) Anyway to give you an idea of what was going on you can see a visualization of the problem below. For better effect (and for us to easier analyze the problem) the corrupted regions of the image (here all of the terrain) are drawn with reddish overlay. Any idea for the picture title?    Want to cheer us up for the multiplayer work? Or feel like laughing at us for taking so long with the trailer? Go to our forums.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #29 - So many ideas", "body": "The tradition is to open the friday facts by saying, that the new bugfix release is here, as well as saying that this one is definitely going to be the stable one. But this time we really think that 0.9.8 is going to be the one :).  We spent very little time with the 0.9 branch as many things for 0.10 are in motion. As we  already said we planned to start using the automated testing, and this week, Tomas finally achieved to revive the testing suite, so we will slowly cover the source code by tests while working. Not only this is needed for the reasons already said, but we need to test all the otherwise hard to test corner cases in network communication logic that is Kuba giving the basic shape to. I'm now doing the hard work of fixing the small errors in determinism. I play the game, while it is saved periodically, then I have to start the replay wait for diversion from the original and find out why it happened by inspecting the differences in the saves. This is cumbersome process, as some of the inconsistencies are very hard to find, but after a few days and several bugfixes, I was able to replay the first tutorial mission without errors while certainly making a new world record of the time to finish the mission :)  I gave myself approximately 1.5 hours daily to play computer games, and when playing these and reading Ideas and suggestions on our forums, it gives me so many ideas of what could be done. It is depressing to know, that all of these ideas, even when considering just the good ones, are just not possible to be made. Fight mechanics, alien pets, water-heating/cooling circuits, other planets, supplying orbit, satellites, ending of the game, different vehicles, airplanes, late-game rts controls of building and combat robot minions, equipment (as in armor) based blueprints for combat robots, enemy/neutral/allied survivors, after-landing phase where you have to take care of the people, caves and underground mining, armored trains, 20 different additions to circuit network, nuclear energy that is not just boiler that runs on uranium, 10 different enemies with different types of behaviours and attacks, different types of enemy bases, forests on fire, working eco-system, other downsides of pollution, snow areas with snow particles on machines, rare random Fallout-like encounters, different energy sources, advanced train controls, disasters, flowing rivers, more complex mechanics of armor equipment,  ... I could continue like this for a long time. We have already Ideas & suggestions section on our forums, but it might be nice to have something more organised, so people could add their ideas and vote/discuss what they think should have priority, or maybe there is a way how to do it directly on the forum, ideas?  I was also thinking, that we might do some kind of technical development blog posts like  this one about Starcraft 1 as we are certainly facing some interesting challenges or hard decisions from time to time, would anyone be interested in that?

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #28 - The pack is back", "body": "Hi there,  the Friday 0.9.x release \"mini tradition\" continues by the release of the 0.9.7 today. Though the changelog is rather long, the amount of code behind those changes is rather small (they were all simple fixes). If the amount of stress and haste before the release would be a measure of release quality then 0.9.7 should do rather good. We released it before Friday lunch without any last minute hotfixes and without any complications.  The pack in the post title refers to the scenario pack. The set of currently 3 \"mini campaigns\" available for the furnace attendant tier or higher. We finally got around to make it compatible with the 0.9.x release branch. So now there is a scenario pack 0.9.7 available that will work with the 0.9.7 binary version. The changes have been quite significant, because the Tight Spot and Supply Challenge had to be rebalanced to take the oil industry into account. The playtesting of these has been a refreshing experience and definitely a good motivation to think about new challenge missions and content for the scenario pack (we still take it as a work in progress). You can check out the main part of the factory that got me through the new Supply Challenge below. It was built in about 3 hours under constant pressure to provide 6 \"hungry chests\" in the center with new and new items - that is why it is called the Supply challenge.  Alongside the bugfix branch for 0.9.x the work in the master branch has continued on some small features for the 0.10 (see the new roadmap). Namely things like environment sound playing and map generation strings. But this is now coming to conclusion and Kuba already started with design and planning for the multiplayer network layer. Immediately some scary technical issues showed up: floating point operations non-determinism across different platforms, peer-to-peer communication for players without public IP addresses, etc. We will definitely not be bored in the near future :)  Recently a lot of old entities have been reskinned or remade. Things like inserters, transport belts or assembling machines are now (0.9.x) consistent with the artistic direction. This is all part of the plan to improve the visuals for our new trailer. It has been taking ages, but we are really getting close now. Albert is now working on doodads and aesthetic tweaks for the trailer map. Actually we just spent like 2 hours discussing some details of the map :) Please bear with us a little longer.

As celebration of the 2^13 copies we are about to approach I made a Factorio version of the game everyone is playing now , the time you can spend on it should justify the shorter length of this text :)  Apart playing 2048 we managed to make 2 bugfix releases this weak just to find out, there are still some small bugs left, but the version is close to be stable for sure.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #26 - How to satisfy achievers", "body": "Hello,\r the spring officially started today here in the Czech republic and it is really beautiful weather here. This is nice, because the \"I need to have a break\" kind of strolls are much more enjoyable now.  I don't want you to confuse with terms you don't know, so you can read in this lengthy article that players can be roughly divided into 4 basic categories Achiever, Explorer, Killer and Socialiser. I believe that I'm 50% achiever 25% explorer and 25% killer, so one of the (many) things I wanted to have for Factorio to be different than just industrially modded Minecraft was to offer the satisfaction for achievers like me. This is the reason why the player is under the pressure of biters that evolve over time instead of having all the time on the world to play and fiddle with factory setups. The achiever wants to fight through the obstacles to get to the goal, but the goal has to be difficult to be meaningful. When I played Starcraft II mission on brutal and I won on the first try, I was dissatisfied, because it was too easy. When I had to fail 3 times to understand the level mechanics and requirements to be able to beat the level after another 2 tries, that was the thing I loved. I loved that I had to think about timings and different approaches to problems and search for combination of the choices that work the best.  But how to do it? How to satisfy us, achievers, in Factorio? How to do it, so non-achievers or beginners will not be discouraged?\r This is the way I believe should be done in the future:\r   Provide much more balanced starting conditions on freeplay (some way of balancing nearby resources to contain the same amounts at least), and provide way to share starting seed so players can compare results on the exact same world. Add difficulty settings for the freeplay (they are not now) that would really make a difference in more aspects of the game, like enemy evolution/expansion speed, aggressiveness, pollution spread etc.so finishing on the hardest difficulty would really be a challenge. Provide something measurable that could be achieved (apart just finishing the game), trying to minimize the time seems like one of the possible solutions, because I really love the kind of strategic thinking, where every decision  matters.  Provide achievements. It is quite mainstream these days, and I believe that there is a good reason for it. It just satisfies us, achievers, and gives us directions as long as these achievements really mean something like: Finish the game under X hours on some preset settings. Accumulate 1 000 000 electronic circuits under X hours, or the other way around, accumulate the biggest amount of electronic circuits possible in 3 hours. Score some big amount of points in the tight spot missions. Make online leaderboards of the these on our site (Another use of the accounts already have). I'm sure there is much more we can do in this direction. The more I think about this, the more I want it :)  The bugfix release of 0.9.4 has been released today and we believe there are just few things to be fixed to have the final stable release so we started to plan for the multiplayer today. We just had a first small meeting and you can see our plan of battle. We will consider it very naive in the upcoming weeks for sure, but better some plan than no plan :)    I'm quite curious what do you think about this, so don't hesitate to comment on our forums.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #25 - Mods and Forums", "body": "Hello,  another bugfix themed week passed and the release is here. When I'm asked to do something on friday and I say that we have the release, the typical answer is something like: \"Again? Didn't you release it last week?\", well we did ... :)  Apart the bugfixing and moral preparation for the MP coding beast, the integration of new sounds for the 0.10 is in progress as well. First experiments of the environment sounds are done, which means that as the player goes through the factory, he can hear nearby machines working. This is very delicate matter as we don't want to make the player turn it off 5 minutes in game, but if done right, it can add a lot to the factory mood.  We are very happy that people communicate on the forum, and I try to read every single post, but the last time  I had marked everything read is more than 2 weeks ago. More than 5 pages of Ideas and Suggestions are waiting. The question is what exactly should we do about it, as the time spent on the forums is getting bigger and bigger every week, and I can easily \"wake up\" after reading it for 2 hours straight and not doing any real work on the game. We are starting to have these habits of reading in quick mode, which usually means just getting some general idea of what is going on in the thread and we usually don't read at all when we see that some other staff member replied already. So if we didn't respond to your thread, please don't take it personally, and If you feel it is important, you can bum it after some time (week at least).  The big part of the work on the modding capabilities of Factorio was done during the days we were unsure about the its future. Working on something that could be used to extend the game that we were not sure anyone would play at all was looking useless. Hopefully we are still here, and new mods are arising. Some of the mods are simple but useful, like the TIme buttons, that is patching the lack of time speed configuration in-game, some are just tempting to be used because of the pictures, like Mocombat, for people that found the production chains not complex enough, there are the content-based mods like Dy tech, F-Mod and more. The growing variety of mods can only exist because modders pushed us to extend the moddability regulary and it proved more than once, that the extended interface was handy to have later even in the core Factorio, not mentioning that mods are also great incubators for new ideas that could grow into the vanilla game. So after all, we rate the time invested on modabbility to be well spent.  The tesla tower from the mocombat:    We are always eager to learn what you think at our forums.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #24 - Inserter reskin", "body": "Hello,  The title says it clearly.  After a long long time, one of the most core elements in the game has been graphically redesigned to fit the art direction. Albert played around with couple of shapes and in the end the winner is surprisingly lightweight and elegant. If you are impatient to see how the new inserters look like, then scroll down and check them out on the screenshot from one of our playtesting games. This is one of our many final preparations for the new trailer, which has been supposed to be finished so long time ago it is not even funny.  Today we have released the 0.9.2. Regular bugfix release at regular time with regular expectations (meaning that more bugs are expected to be found - the forum users are becoming pros in this :)). There are also couple of small balancing changes that should make the game slightly better (namely that poison capsules will hurt worms as well now, oil industry is not needed for making cars and trains and that pipe to ground is longer). Check out  the details  for  yourself. While this release still will probably not become the stable release, we feel we are slowly getting there.  We are about to start planning what to do after 0.9 is stable. As mentioned couple of times in the past we feel that the time has come to take on the multiplayer. This will be a gargantuan task indeed - at least for us, maybe Chuck Norris would wrap up the whole thing by simply giving the 0s and 1s on the hard drive an angry look. But he has better things to do I guess, so it is up to us to do it the old fashioned way - designing and writing the code. So the MP will be developed in a separate branch by +- 2 people (we will be rotating), this will leave some small development power to carry on with the standard release cycle - working on little features and improvements, integrating new graphics, etc. And just to clear up the speculations, the next planned release will be 0.10 not 1.0 :D  Now a small rant on Indie vs. AAA. Recently kovarex has played quite a bit of Starcraft II - namely the Terran and Zerg campaigns. I was watching him playing now and then. He was extremely positive about the whole experience. Namely the level of detail and playability were supposedly superb. Playing AAA games can be quite intimidating for the Indie developer. But then there are the credits. It turned out that SC II was done by a LOT of people. We don't have the exact numbers but we suppose there will be like couple of hundreds of people in the team. We have 4 people in the core team now (plus we work with freelancers here and there). So we made some rough estimates taking into account that SC II took 7 years to develop and it sold around 5M copies. Let's presume it will take us at least till next years summer to \"finish\" the game (see the last post:)). Let's also assume that we will manage to sell 50k copies by then (which we believe is doable). After some rounding (yeah many things can be achieved by \"good rounding\") and some math we get that we could have 0.5% of costs and also 0.5% of revenue compared to SC II. So in the end the Indie vs. AAA struggle doesn't look that futile :)    We are always eager to learn what you think at our forums.

{"page_num": "38", "name": "Friday Facts #23 - Year after", "body": "Good evening everyone,  it is almost 1 year since the end of our Indiegogo campaign. The beginning of the campaing was kind of gloomy and hopeless, after one week we were ready to resign the whole project and we both even had a programming job in reserve. But eventually things turned around and thanks to many awesome people supporting us, we managed to finish the campaign sucessfully and continue working on Factorio fulltime. That is the \"well known history\" and you can read more about it in the older blog posts.  What is less known is what happened after the campaign. The end of the campaign made us actually over confident at the time. We felt that all is going to be easy peasy since then. We were wrong once again. We had to go through some rough times, often balancing close to the zero on our bank account with the game being not more than \"an interesting proof of concept\". The original estimate was that the game would be finished by the summer of 2013, simply because the summer seemed like far enough in the future back then in February. Now we believe that if we try hard enough, the game could be \"finished\" by summer 2015 (because that DOES look like far enough in the future :)), but better not to make any estimates ... So these days it is a bit of balancing time for us, comparing to where we were a year ago. The \"now\" is definitely winning (except for the compilation times).  The efforts to stabilize the 0.9 release have continued this week as well. We want the 0.9.2 to be a \"stable release candidate\", that means it should have all the major reported bugs fixed and the campaings and scenario pack must be working. This is not ready at the moment, therefore we will wait with the 0.9.2 release till sometimes in the next week. Also recently we have spent quite some time on administrative tasks - namely working out the taxes and also going through the application process for accepting credit cards on our website (let's keep the fingers crossed that paymill will give us a green light in the end).  Albert has been busy (as usual) and productive (as usual as well). We decided to spend some time repairing our graphical debts and redo the most common entities that were done before our artistic direction has been established. First in the row was the assembling machine. You can say goodbye to \"tint abuse\" that was used to produce two extra levels from a single assembling machine animation. Now there are three separate animations with different movement mechanisms in the top part. The preview of animations is shown below. The problem is that the less \"old style\" (and non-fitting) objects there are in the game, the more visible they are compared to the rest. This makes the inserters and transport belts next candidates for re-skinning ...    If you like the new assembling machines (and even if you don't), then tell us about it on our forum.

Well they are tough fellas these biters so they got their claws sharpened, got some of their best boys together and set off for a revenge mission on the players' base. If you want to see them in action sweeping through a poorly protected oil expansion then check out the composition below. It was made by Albert, our fearless reporter from the Factorio planet.  Now back to the Earth. Or more specifically Prague, yes that pretty city in the middle of Europe, where (among other wonderful things) the Factorio team is working day and night to deliver you the best build-factories-in-your-computer experience. And the day and night is not an overstatement. The \"programming department\" (me, kovarex and blue cube) usually works from something like 9 am to 7 pm. The working hours are VERY flexible. The part of the \"working shift\" is regular lunch with brainstorming at awesome local restaurant called The Carp in the honey (yeah no kidding - and they actually do serve the Carp in honey). The \"art department\" (Albert) has recently been in habit of working overnight. There are days when we chat in the morning after I wake up and he is just about to go to bed. Well the result is that sometimes (during very hectic days) we have a 24hr Factorio \"development coverage\". We do jokes about it, but it is definitely not something that we are proud or happy about. And actually it is getting better, in the early days we didn't do anything else then sit at home and code the game, nowadays the atmosphere is way more relaxed.  Alright, so our efforts in the past week have been spent mostly on cutting down the massive list of bug reports that appeared after the Friday's 0.9 release. These efforts have culminated tonight by making  the 0.9.1 bugfix release. While it fixes a lot of bugs we don't really expect it to become stable, namely after experiences from 0.7.x and 0.8.x generations :). Also some things are just not finished yet - like a migration of campaign or scenario pack to the new oil recipes. But if you were one of those who got corrupted saves from 0.9, chances are that this release will solve the problem for you. That is actually the reason why we tried to push it before the weekend. But as usual, no guarantees.  We have been looking for someone to work on Factorio icons/items/technology images and graphic design in general for a while. It seems like we might have found such a person in the end. We will bring you more details when the deal is closed, for now it must suffice to say that the person is a she so Factorio could get a bit of a womans touch :). Also the rumors are that new assembling machine graphics are just around the corner, so stay tuned...    No comments, no fun. Tell us what you think on our forum.

The last group is us.  We have been preparing the 0.9 release for a while now. Originally it was planned for the end of January, but we took the two extra weeks. That seemed like a lot of time back then:) Last weekend all looked smooth and easy, all the features were finished, we started playtesting. No major issues, the oil industry felt like a refreshing addition to the game, blueprints were blueprinting and the sky was blue (literally). However somehow during the week it started falling apart - a lot of small bugs came up, some more balancing, half a day here, half a day there and BANG suddenly it was Friday morning. With the last graphical piece (the chemical plant) still on the way, some non-trivial reworks done yesterday and a staring list of bugs on the forum the outlook was bleak. But we put ourselves together and made the sprint necessary to deliver the 0.9.0 as promised.  The 0.9.0 will probably be \"very experimental\" which is a diplomatic way to say that we expect a lot of bugs to come up:) Heck, we were fixing the bugs all day long. We considered to postpone the release for a couple of days but we promised to deliver it this Friday and a lot of people were waiting for it joking about cancelling their dates to play the game, etc. So it is out now, if you are brave enough then go ahead and try it.  The oil industry brings the oil spills, the pumpjacks, the refineries and a recipe redesign. We took the opportunity to do some more significant changes to other existing recipes as well. We went after having more \"meaningful\" intermediate products than before. The car will require an engine, the robots will need a flying robot frame, the rocket is made from the explosives and the list goes on ... . The feeling from the internal playtesting was more interesting gameplay compared to before when everything was made from the iron plates and circuits. However the result will be that most of the existing factories will just stop working. You can either take it as a challenge to get it up the speed or just start the new game :)  Albert hasn't slept that much in the past few days. Last night he hasn't slept at all while he was finishing the chemical plant. Even today instead of taking the rest he gathered his energy and prepared a special Valentine's composition. It is called \"Saint Valentine's Day Massacre\".    Today is no exception, we are waiting for your comments at our forum.

{"page_num": "39", "name": "Friday Facts #19", "body": "Hi there,  after feeble weather during the Christmas it finally feels a bit like winter here in Prague. There is the snow outside, the air is fresh and some warm clothing is a must. When we add a new terrain into the game (and we will) it will definitely be the snow. Just imagine all those machines standing on the snow and puffing the smoke, furnaces glowing with fire and maybe even having traces of snow all over them. I am already looking forward to it:)  All the big programming tasks for the 0.9 are finished and now we are working our way through our never ending issues list. They are either bugfixes, polishing tasks or small features. We have added couple of neat things, for example: better visible entities on the map, the \"copy entity settings\" feature (previously shift build) or possibility to have custom directories in the saves directory. In the beginning of the week we had around 30 closed and 30 opened tickets. Now we have over 50 closed tickets but 35 opened ones. The new ones keep springing up like mushrooms. The funny thing is that quite a few of these are more than 6 months old and they just keep \"travelling across the releases\" (when it is time to make the release we move all the unfinished issues to the next one). And of course in case we would actually finish everything, there is always a huge  repository of ideas and suggestions  to choose from at our forums:)  In one of the previous posts I mentioned that the music for our new trailer(yes, we plan to release it eventually) has been done by Daniel, a musician from the United Kingdom. We decided to continue working together and came up with a plan for complete \"soundification\" of the game. Yes, we have some sounds at the moment but these are both incomplete and incoherent (they are mostly royalty free sounds we found ourselves in the dusty corners of the internet). We will start by replacing and extending the sounds we have at the moment and then we will move on to make sounds for every moving machine in the game. The sounds of the machines would be then played based on the players position and they should evoke a feeling of \"walking through the factory\". This is very hard thing to do, because the sounds must play well together, not be too aggressive but also not too monotonous. It might not work out, but we think it is worth a try. And of course this has been suggested before on our forums:) The creation of sounds for the game will be a continunous process, but some first results are coming already in the 0.9.  When people see Factorio for the first time, one of their reactions often is: \"oh, a 2D game :| \". Well yes, the Factorio engine works with 2D sprites and all the animations are done by showing sequences of the object in different positions (basically a motion picture). But behind all this there is a twist. All the objects in the game (including the terrain) have actually been rendered from the 3D models (and all of these models have been done by Albert:)). This results in animations with surprising amount of details (at least we hope so). A good example is the new machine Albert has been working on for the past couple of days. It is the oil pumpjack and in my opinion it instantly became one of the best machines in the game. There is a preview of couple of pumpjacks in the desert, together with a detailed look taken from the Blender when Albert was animating the model.    As always, your comments are more than welcome on our forum.

{"page_num": "39", "name": "Friday Facts #18", "body": "Hello,  today the Factorio Friday Facts turn 18. That is considered an age of maturity in many countries. So the glass of Jagermeister on my desk is completely justified :)  The time here in Prague feels just like whooshing around us faster and faster with the end of January approaching rapidly. That was the original estimate for the release of 0.9 but now it seems      that it will take a week or two more. The usual \"everything takes longer than expected\" has applied this time as well. The current development version has placeholders for some new entities (like a plain rectangle box saying \"oil refinery\" or another one with \"chemical plant\") and we really want to make proper graphics for these and deliver the basics of new oil content as a whole package.  Recently we got a bug report  claiming that the game is too slow. The guy who posted it was right, the game was running well under 60fps. In our defence it needs to be added that his factory was pretty monstrous. It was actually the biggest one we have seen by far. Just to get an idea, his factory had 9000 solar panels, 15 000 laser turrets and thousands of logistic robots. So kovarex took it as a challenge to squeeze as much performance from the engine as possible taking this save as a reference. He has been working on it for the past couple of days.  The most significant optimizations he made are:    Efficient dispatch of pending logistic robots. This was probably the cause of the biggest slowdown in the given save.   Wake-on-demand mechanism for inserters. Until now the inserters always asked every tick the objects in front of / behind itself whether they should transfer anything. Now, instead they put themselves to sleep and the object wakes them up when its state changes (that means there is a chance a transfer will be required).   Improved cache locality for the electric energy network.    The result: game update dropped from roughly 30 milliseconds per 1 update to about 10 milliseconds (and there is more to come). Of course not everybody will get this amount of performance improvement (the optimizations are aiming at the game update for big factories). But in general this batch of improvements pushes the bar for the size of the factory further up.  The work on the oil industry has entered the last phase. The fluid and recipe mechanisms as well as new entities are ready and now it is all about adding the actual content. I have been studying the oil refining process quite a bit recently and also I took this opportunity to refresh some bits from my high school chemistry curriculum. The way it shapes now the oil industry will be a middle to late game resource. Its usage will start somewhere between the green and blue science pack and its products will cover a variety of areas (fuel, plastics, lubricants, explosives, etc.). There has been quite some discussion about the oil industry on the forums. If you are interested and want to contribute your opinion you can do so in  this thread for instance.  Kuba and Albert have been working together a bit on the integration of the new doo-dads into the map generator. The goal is to approach the scenery compositions shown in the  previous  posts . Though that is difficult (because those compositions are hand made and imho very good) the doo-dads should greatly improve the current flatness of the landscape anyway. On top of this Kuba has been busy with a neat feature when the game will natively treat zip archives as directories (so the saves / mods can be zip packages). And of course Albert's table is full of \"oily stuff\" - now comes the interesting part - the oil mining drill, the oil refinery and the chemical plant.  Today's picture is a glimpse into the internals of Factorio. The screenshot shows a diagram of entities' (objects on the map) class inheritance structure generated by doxygen.

{"page_num": "39", "name": "Friday Facts #17", "body": "Hello there,  the 17th of January brings you the 17th edition of the Friday Facts. Recently, even without our active participation the game has been doing quite well.    There are plenty of new videos on the youtube and the forum has also been buzzing with activity. One of our fans put it as follows: \"Factorio is going places\".    Well, we certainly hope he is right :). Anyway let's get down to business.  The past week has been spent mostly by work on the new functionality for the 0.9. The blueprints and the oil industry. Both of these are quite large tasks so  to finish them completely does take a lot of time. Though the core functionality for both is finished and we are now sort of tweaking the details.  I have experimented a bit with some new simple pipe vs. assembler setups and it was quite refreshing and fun. We are really curious how this turns out.  The oil industry will result in quite a few new recipes and while we are at it we might go and rebalance the recipes overall a bit. There are things we know  for sure should be fixed (for instance the green science pack being too cheap and close to the red one) and there are things we want to experiment with a little bit  (like introducing a more complex intermediate products - small engine, navigation system, etc.).  We haven't mentioned our new trailer for a while. The thing is that we struggled for long to find someone who would be able to compose the music for the video.  We even mentioned that in one of the past Friday Facts. After that post we actually got contacted by a  player who bought the game and was following its development news. His name is Daniel James Taylor and he is an awesome (now we know that :)) composer  from the United Kingdom. Check out his website if you are interested in more details / his music samples. We agreed on the cooperation  and he went and composed a great piece of music fitting our new trailer very well. We are now discussing with Daniel further cooperation regarding the sound effects and ambient music for the game.  With the music finished, the biggest bulk of the work for the trailer has been done.  The last step is to integrate the new graphics (terrain, doo-dads, etc.) into the trailer and polish it to perfection :) This will most probably happen after the 0.9, but we are getting there.  Since the \"job advertisement\" worked so well last time for the music, we have another one :). It is very apparent to anyone opening the game that the items, gui icons, technology  pictures, etc. are a mess. So we are looking for a graphic designer to help us out here. Albert's todo list is long enough already and this job is a lot of work.  We would prefer someone from the Czech Republic or the vicinity (for easier communication), but the music experience has proved that a quality cooperation can be done based solely on electronic communication as well.  Let's see, maybe we will get lucky twice :)  Albert has been \"in the oil industry state\" for a while. We found out that the current pipes are not fitting the art direction very well. Therefore we decided  to take a step back and redo the pipes before anything else. The pipes are the base for the other machines so it certainly needs to be done. It does slow the things now a bit, but as the wise man once said: \"If you want to run fast, you need to tie your laces well. Or go barefoot.\"  So below is a composition preview of the new pipes and storage tanks that will be used for holding large amounts of fluids.

{"page_num": "39", "name": "Friday Facts #16", "body": "Good evening Factorians,  today we had a presentation about the game at one of the universities here in Prague for the subject called \"Video game development\". It was focused on what is it like to develop an indie game. So yesterday  we spent some time reflecting the past year and a half to come up with topics to talk about. We were thinking a lot about the period about a year ago before the Indiegogo campaign started, when the game was completely unknown  to the public and we were close to burning out. The positive finding wat that as opposed to that period the work is now much less stressful and generally enjoyable. Maybe we (and people in general) should think about our down moments more often to better appreciate what we have ...  Last Friday Facts promised a stable 0.8 release in the beginning of this week. Well, that was a false promise because couple of more bugs have been found that resulted in the new record for number of bugfix releases. Now we  have the 0.8.8 in the experimental stage. If there are no serious issues found this will be made stable during the weekend. Having so many bugfix releases is rather annoying (and we plan to improve here by starting with automated testing) but it doesn't slow us down in the regular development. We have multiple development branches and the work on the 0.9 has been going for a while in the master branch, while the bugfixes are collected in the current release branch (the 0.8.x) and then merged back into the master.  Talking about the 0.9, the work has been progressing well. Quite some internal rework of concepts is required for the oil industry and fluids in general. However, yesterday we already had an assembling machine that makes a recipe from some items and water supplied by the pipe. For this to work the recipe mechanism has been generalized and in the end (not yet done) following will be possible:     The recipe ingredient can be a fluid.  The recipe can have multiple results (both items and fluids).  The results of the recipe can be randomized (there will be a probability of getting the result and a min - max range for the amount of the result).    There might not be much more fluid content aside from the oil (and its variations) in the 0.9, however the mechanisms will be there for the modders to play with and take advantage of them. And we are curious what they come up with:)  Kovarex has been working on the native blueprints for some time and he has the core functionality more or less finished. Of course that is just a small portion of the total work required (polishing, bugfixing, integration with other concepts, etc.) but it is something that can already be played with in the 0.9 branch. And it is actually quite fun to play with. The system is relatively straightforward now:     You make the blueprint item.  You select what to store in it (you get the blueprint preview on the item afterwards).   You place it and the construction robots build it.     You can check it out on the mini picture series below, where blueprints have been used to build the standard furnace line.

The entertainment was provided by the usual elements - food, drinks, chatting and board games. The traditional fireworks  all over the Prague kickstarted the 2014, which is going to be a crucial year for Factorio. The main points from the 2014 battle plan are:    Get on the Steam.   Get the multiplayer done.   Get some quality holidays:).  After some relaxed time during the Christmas we are back to full speed development. There will be a stable release of the 0.8 in the beginning of the next week. The periods necessary for release stabilization has been getting  longer and longer. That was one of the reasons we decided to dedicate more time in the future to the automated testing. You can read more on this topic in our latest random ramblings.  Past week has been spent by working on the new features for the 0.9. Mainly the oil industry and blueprints. Both are still in the process of development so I will go into the functional details later, after they are more or less stabilized. You can also read our plans regarding the functionality in that random ramblings post. One thing is clear already. The 0.9 is a very ambitious release and if all goes well it will be one of our most content rich releases (if not the most content rich). After the 0.9 we plan to start working on the multiplayer which might be a long period with little other updates. Therefore we plan to get a lot done before that.  In the meantime, Albert has finished with a first set of doo-dads. Below is a composition with some new shipwrecks. Actually the current shipwreck sprite in the first level was cut (and adjusted) from one of our theme art pictures (can you find it:)?). It is time for this one to be replaced.

{"page_num": "39", "name": "Friday Facts #14", "body": "Hi there,  past week has not been the most productive one in the Factorio history. The Christmas was a good opportunity to take couple of days off, relax and spend some time with the family. In the meantime some more bugs have popped  up in the 0.8.x resulting in the release of the 0.8.4, the current shot at the stable release.  The end of the year is a good time to look backward and do some balancing. Many things have happened in the 2013 but for me, one of them clearly stands out. And that is the change in sort of a general feeling from the project. What I mean is following. In the beginning of the year we didn't have a plan, we didn't have an artistic direction, we didn't have any income, we were just two guys working over-full-time from the living room on kind of a hobby project. I remember that those  were often desperate times filled with insecurity about the future. The comparison to now is staggering. We received the trust in the Indiegogo campaign, 5000 people (almost there) have bought the game, there is a great community at our forums, we have a clear roadmap and we are working on it, the looks of the game have improved drastically and we now have an actual artistic direction to follow, and much more...  All in all we overcame many obstacles, some of them seemed impossible a year ago. Of course it hasn't been all smooth ride, but the despair and uncertainty are gone. Yes, often there is the stress (especially during the sprint before the release) or anxiety but, I think that is unavoidable and it often actually pushes us forward. Overall Factorio now feels to me like a healthy project with clear direction rather than a very uncertain experiment it was a year ago. We all have worked hard to achieve this but a big thanks goes also to our fans, without you we wouldn't succeed in the Indiegogo, we wouldn't have the funds to continue the development later on when things started to drag and also we wouldn't have all the positive feedback that have kept us going. Thank you!  Now, for a more humorous look on what the development of Factorio is like check out  this series of gifs  by Kovarex on our forums.

Take the opportunity to have some rest and recharge your energy (we certainly will). We have also prepared a small present for you. It is a never-before publicly released prototype of the game from the autumn 2012, so it is more than a year old. It is from so long ago that the game was not yet called Factorio. At that time we provisionally called it Energycraft. There are only the win32 and win64 binaries available (you can use emulator on other systems). Bundled with the game are 2 saves from that time, so you can have a look at some existing factories. Playing that version even for couple of minutes brings back a lot of nostalgia:) Merry Christmas everyone!  If you wish to leave some comments you can do so on our forums.

{"page_num": "39", "name": "Friday Facts #13", "body": "Hello,  another Friday means another update on what is happening here in the Factorio central in Prague. It doesn't really feel like the Christmas are actually around the corner. There is no snow (just cold) and the shopping spree / Christmas tree hunt doesn't really affect us that much:) Therefore the only clear signal that the year is coming to an end has been the Christmas concert we attended with Kovarex.  The stabilization of the 0.8 has been our main topic for the past week. We have found and fixed many bugs ranging from little annoyances to serious game-crashing or save-corrupting beasts. The 0.8.1 contained a magical  number of 42 bugfixes, but unfortunately some of the fixes brought in new bugs (this happens so often that it became a programming folklore). Therefore we made another bugfix release - the 0.8.2 which has been published today and so far it has been looking good.  The way I put it sometimes, the bugfixing probably sounds like a boring / tedious work. Well there is not that much creativity involved, but it can get really interesting. It is like solving a puzzle or a small criminal case of your own. In the beginning you only have the problem. Then you are looking around, noticing small odities and other clues. If you need, you can use the debugger or debugging prints to get a glimpse of what is happening behind the curtains. You need to think a lot and picture how the different parts of the code interact and what could be going on. You make a hypothesis, test it and often ... find nothing. But in the end you get this AHAAA moment when everything becomes clear and the source of the problem is revealed. Actually fixing the bug is usually the simple part, once you have traced its origin. The AHAAA moment feels really good, it is like figuring out a riddle or solving a tricky math problem.  Kuba started working on the biomes for the 0.9. The model he is using is taking into account two semi-independent variables: the temperature and the humidity. The noise of temperature and humidity is generated over the map, assigning a specific combination of values to every tile. The placement of terrain and doo-dads (trees, rocks, fauna, etc.) are driven by these two variables. For instance, the definition of plain green tree would say that it has the peak at humidity of 0.5 and temperature of 17 degrees. The probability distribution is then formed around this peak to determine whether the tree should be placed on a given tile (based on the tile's temperature and humidity values). In the end, based on these definitions, the different biomes should emerge (we are already curious if they do:)). Below there is an image which demonstrates the relationship between biomes and humidity / temperature.  Albert is at the moment working on the doo-dads (new trees, rocks, plants, etc.) to give the environment a realistic feel. We have collected quite some feedback on the new logo direction in the past week. Personally, the biggest surprise to me has been that a lot of people would prefer the current logo to the old one. We still believe in the new logo and we will use the feedback from the forums and emails to improve it (experimenting with the color, increased readability, the wheel shape, etc.).  The second post picture is called \"The giant and the machines\". It demonstrates the scale functionality of the engine that can be used to draw scaled pictures on the fly rather than scaling them first. This way the picture uses both less space on the drive (some mods are already bigger than the vanilla game:)) and less video memory. It was really funny to see the giant player walking around the tiny machines:)         As always you can let us know what you think in the dedicated post on our forum.

We didn't want to make a blogpost on Friday the 13th because for sure something would go wrong. And also I am on a skiing trip in Austria and I was too tired yesterday to do anything, after all the day going downhills.  So the 0.8.0 has been succesfully released last Friday. We finished at the same time when first guests for the party started coming. We just crossed our fingers, pressed the release button (maybe we should have a real, big, red \"release\" button) and went off to drink beer and talk to people. The cake (see the picture in the last post) was delicious:) Back to the release - there were small issues, but nothing really major (\"Pump cannot be built\" kind of thing). We have already fixed most of the reported issues for the 0.8.1, which will happen in the beginning of the next week.  We haven't worked on anything major aside from the issues. We took the time to relax after the intensive release sprint (says the guy who has been skiing all day long:). Kovarex was playing some games (including classics like Dune 2000) looking for inspiration. There was also a long conversation about how the new industry with oil and chemicals should work. Interesting things ahead.  Originally we wanted to start the Steam Greenlight campaign before the Christmas. Now it is clear that this will not happen. The reason is that the music for the new trailer is not yet ready. The cooperation with the guy we hired for the music hasn't brought the expected result. So we are back where we started. Recently, we found a composer in Prague, who looks like a very good fit for the job, but he will not have time until after Christmas. At least Albert will have more time to work on doodads for the game (and the trailer) - things like trees, rocks, etc.  Albert also took the opportunity to work on something completely different for a while and he came up with a proposal for the new Factorio logo. The old (current) logo has been done by me and then face-lifted by another artist. But still it looks painfully amateurish. The new logo doesn't have that problem:) Together with the logo Albert worked on the new forum style, this will be deployed sometimes next week.  So here is the thing. We actually have two proposals for the logo. And we would appreciate some help and opinions for deciding which one to use. You can see the proposals below. They are shown on the potential loading screen of the game. We do have our preference but will not say which one that is to avoid influencing the outcome. They both work as links for larger versions.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #11", "body": "Hi there,  after a hectical sprint, the 0.8.0 release is done. We have continuously reported on the progress, so the content of the release won't be a big surprise.  Still, you can checkout the  release notes  on our forums. And if you are brave enough you can even try it out. The thing is that considering the circumstances the release will be \"very\" experimental.  We have fixed all the major errors and crashes we came acrros. But still there were plenty of changes under the hood in non-trivial areas (namely the logistic system) so there are a lot of potential places for error.  Just a reminder, you need to set \"Enable experimental updates\" in the \"Other settings\" for the builtin updater to update your version to 0.8.0.  After a major release we usually take a day or two off. This time it will be no exception. Moreover it was Kovarex's birthday yesterday, so today in the evening we will have a party in our place. After the headaches  are gone, the place is clean again and we recharge our batteries, we will be after the (supposedly found) bugs in 0.8 and planning the 0.9. It is kind of a never ending story:).  The last bigger feature we worked on for the 0.8 was the Roboport. That is the \"home\" for the logistic and construction robots, where they can charge, station and which navigates them on the map. This neatly solves some issues there  were with the logistic system before:    Balancing - Roboport requires quite some energy to charge the robots. So the Logistic Robots will be less overpowered than they have been.  Stationing - In the past robots without orders kept hanging at the place where they stopped. This was annoying and even caused robots to become a target for enemies after they delivered stuff to the player's inventory.                     Now every robot that has nothing to do goes to the roboport to station there.   Area Separation - Before, all the logistic robots could fly all over the map. From the base to the expansion if necessary. Following the player fighting the enemy bases, etc.    This was also less than desirable. Now the connections between the roboports define separate logistic networks which can't be mixed. This way, small independent systems can be setup in the expansions and one large network in the    main base for instance.        And on top of all that the roboports look really cool:D Albert happily took the break from the terrain and made a great machine in a short amount of time. You can checkout the \"making of\" animation below.  Some of the instructional pictures in the demo were getting really outdated. So we replaced them with setups with the current graphics. Below is a side-by-side comparison for the instruction on how to use inserters from some months ago and from now.  The last picture is the courtesy to Kovarex's grandmother, who made this wonderful cake for his birthday.    The tradition is the commenting thread on our forum.

Albert had this observation yesterday and it is very precise description of our development. In the start I had no idea what will the game be like, I had no plans about the visual styles and proportions of the project that was just a hobby, an experiment.  The rails were the first graphical assignment for Albert. I told him to just \"do the rails\" like it was some obvious one way street task. I didn't give him any clues about the style. Should it be cartoonish? Should it be realistic? Should it look modern, cyberpunk or 19th century like? We didn't know, we were searching for the   direction on the fly.  Any manager would probably say this is a bad thing, that we need a roadmap for the whole process from the start to the final release with all the contents, features and graphics planned ahead including cost estimates. I personally think, that the freedom of the jam (agile) way of development that allows us to react is the best for Factorio. We are inventing and extending the best ideas on the run, ideas that would never be visible in the start.  The 0.8  We have less than a week for the preparation of the 0.8, we integrated all the new terrain tilesets to the game, Tomas is now working on the roboports, and construction robots can reconstruct   destroyed buildings. We have few days to add some smaller features before we start bugfixing and preparing for the release.  The new terrain  The main graphical task of the 0.8 is almost finished. You can judge for yourself:    The roboport  The roboport is the control building for the logistic/construction robots, it will provide the radio signal with limited range for these to operate. This will limit the robots from following the player out of the factory and allow the player to have more distinct logistic systems. Apart from that, the robots will recharge there and stock inside if they have nothing to do.  Reconstruction of destroyed buildings  When any building owned by player is destroyed while he has the construction robots researched, the half transparent \"ghost\" building appear on top of the remnants. This ghost building has limited lifetime (5 minutes) and if the needed component is available in the local logistic system, the construction robots take it and automatically reconstruct the building.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #9", "body": "Hello,  since we started with the Friday Facts series, it seems to me that the Fridays have been coming more and more often. So here we are again with the handful of fresh news from the Factorio back stage.  There is a good news and an even better news regarding the 0.8 release. The good news is that we have a definitive release date now. The date has been set to the Friday, the 6th of December. The even better news is that   it will be Kovarexs' birthday the day before that, so there will be two reasons to celebrate on that Friday night:).  On Tuesday the first ever \"FactorioCon\" took place. It was not really a conference, more like a spontaneous meeting. Here is what happened. In the reaction to the previous Friday post we got a message from one of our players on the forums, that he would be coming to Prague for the week. So we agreed to grab a beer on Tuesday night. In the beginning it was supposed to be just me and Kovarex but in the end all the Factorio team was present and even two more of our fans from Prague came (my brother and a friend of his:)). So we were 7 people. We took a beer and snacks in a pub by the river and had a good chat about the game (and life - the usual topic of pub chats).  Most of the map editor functionality, mentioned in the last post is done. This occupied the majority of my time over the past week. Now it is actually a pleasure to work with . Maybe it is a subjective feeling, because I had to do some maps with the old editor:) Anyway the mechanism of layers and tools is in place and easy to extend in the future. So we will release the new editor into the wild, gather the feedback from people on the forum and then incorporate it back in if necessary.  Includes. They are killing us. Factorio is written in C++ which has an old-school-textually-include-stuff approach to referencing objects in other files. This means that the compile time goes up fast with the growing codebase. Compile time is very unproductive kind of time. And it has been going up steadily. At the moment the Factorio core code base has almost 130k lines of code and it takes a fair amount of time to compile. My 2011 MacBookPro 13\" takes already around 8 minutes to build the whole project from scratch. Sometime I take the time to wash the dishes or do a bit of exercise. But most of the time I just kill those 8 minutes by surfing the web or staring at the rolling compilation log. To battle this we have spent quite some time pruning the includes in the past days (it has not been the first time). Kuba was playing with some existing clang include analyzers while Kovarex wrote his own small tool to gather include statistics and try the trial and error include removal (remove - try compile - iterate). This is what the game development includes (pun intended) as well.  Albert has defeated the deamons of the water and now he started integrating the new terrains together. On the other hand we are still struggling with the algorithm for correcting the terrain border transitions.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #8", "body": "Hello everyone,  The preparation for the next release (the 0.8) are in the full speed. Original expected release date was today, but we are not ready yet. It will take at least two to three more weeks. Especially the graphical work on the new terrain   has proved to be more trickier than we expected.  Last week we had some good sales driven mostly by the people from the US. That had a very positive effect both on our credit balance but more importantly on our moral strength. We have been working on Factorio for a long time   with a lot of uncertainty regarding the outcome. We keep getting moral boost from people on our forums but actually selling the game feels great. The absolute numbers were not staggering (the peak was at around 50 sold copies per day) but for us they were still high above average (usually it is like 10 copies per day). So the mood is better now, we even went out for some social activities this week.  Back to the programming. The repair robots mentioned in the last post are done. Michal is fast:) He spent past couple of days with smaller tasks we had on the list for a while. Now he is fiddling with \"ghost\" entities (transparent outlines of entities without bounding box). These will be used for reconstructing entities that has been completely destroyed and in the future also for the blueprints.  I have spent most of the time from the past week improving the map editor.  We have quite a few mods for Factorio, but very little maps / scenarios. The people on the forums asked for the better editor multiple times, so we listened to them. Also during the work on the trailer I confirmed just how big pain it is to use the map editor. Now on to the features. I have a list full of things that need to be done, but couple of most important ones are:     Terrain painting - before only one tile at a time could have been changed. Now there is a brush with different sizes that can change the surface pretty fast.   Laying out the resource fields - The biggest pain in the old editor. Resources had to be laid out one by one and then manually increased by holding a specified key. Now the brush or spray can be used to do that in matter of seconds.   Creating forests - Not so common, but still time consuming. Creating big forests one tree at a time will be a history by using a brush to draw many trees at once.   Copying entity strutures - Moving a part of the factory 10 tiles to the right is not possible now. The plan is to allow some sort of selection and copy-pasting that selection to other place on the map.  Inventory manipulation - Chests can be filled only one stack at a time now. I still don't know how, but this will be improved.     From the above list the first two tasks are finished already. The rest is work in progress but will be ready for 0.8:). The map editor early preview is below. The tabs at the top left represent different layers(terrain, tiles, entities, items). Below is the tool list. The active tool is the spray which I used to spray the coal field.    The usual thread for comments is on our forum.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #7", "body": "Hi guys,  we are back here for another Friday update. We marched through the \"bugfix hell\" to release the 0.7.5 as a stable version in the beginning of the weekend. This allowed us to clear our minds and completely focus on   the next release in progress - the 0.8.  The work on the new trailer is going well. The first prototype started a good discussion on the forum. We took a lot of points from that discussion and came up with an updated trailer. It is a very tiring job - keep iterating   over the same 2 minutes over and over again, fixing small things, changing the timings, playing with the composition, etc. However the more work we invest in this, the more confident we get about it. Maybe it is a self-dellusion,   or it is really getting better. We really want to get it right. One thing is for sure, the result will be on a completely different level than the old trailer. Since the majority of work is done we also got in touch with a French artist from Dijon, who will make the music for the trailer. So far, the reference music for us has been the lively jazz Twilight in Turkey by Raymond Scott.  Today we had a good discussion about one of the upcoming features in the 0.8. Repairs and the repairing robots. For a long time there has been no concept of repair in the game. \"Need to repair an almost destroyed turret? Sure, just mine it and build it again. Voila here it is - brand new, shiny and shooting.\" This will change. We came up with the following:  There will be a new object - the repair kit. This will be a universal tool to repair anything. The repair kit will be produced from some low end materials (like iron plate + electronic circuit). The repair kit will be slowly consumed when used. The player can use the repair kit to repair anything by hand. This is nice, but it is not really a Factorio style. On top of that there will be repairing robots. These can use repair kits to repair anything that is broken. The solution to dispatching the repairing robots will be probably the same as the (yet not implemented) solution to dispatching the logistic robots. There will be a robot tower which will refuel the robots and provide a radio distance for them in which they can operate. By creating multiple of these towers the whole repair system can be automated. The first version will probably be without the robot tower to try the concept out. Oh and of course in the future     the repair robots will be able to recreate destroyed objects:)  One of the biggest changes in the 0.8 will be the new terrain. Maybe now it is a good time to briefly describe how it will be different. There are three main points:     Everything from 3D - All the new terrains are based on Blender 3D models. This makes the tiling and creating multiple variations much easier because Albert can use the full power of Blender to change the surface shapes, add tileable noise or run the whole thing through a predefined transformation. He is definitely much happier doing this than fiddling the pixels (that is how the current terrain has been done).        More variations  - At the moment every terrain has only 4 variations of 1x1 tile. This makes an obvious \"grid-like\" look. The new terrain will challenge this flaw by having multiple tile sizes.     At the moment these will be 1x1, 2x2 and 4x4 (the engine can also handle 8x8). The numbers of variations differ based on the terrain type, but on average it is like 16 for every tile size. This means that one kind of the terrain     will consist of roughly 50 tiles. Different variations can be assigned different probabilities for the map generation. This will result in more natural look of the terrain.        Biomes  - We plan to introduce a concept of a biom. This is an area of the map where only certain terrains and certain doo-dads can appear (for instance green trees will not appear in the desert). It is not     yet sure how much of this will be introduced in 0.8, but it is the direction we will take for the future.    Of course making the terrain look better means a lot (a LOT) of work. Albert needs to come up with a good model and textures. Make sure they go along with other terrains and existing structures / machines. Then create enough variations, test the whole thing in the game itself and often iterate the whole process. At the moment he is working on the last terrain for this update - the water. This is especially tricky because of the lighting. He made a nice   preview from his experiments. I think that the winner candidate is the blue looking one in the middle.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #6", "body": "Hello,  this week the Friday Facts are coming a little bit earlier. The reason is that in the evening I will be lost somewhere in the middle of Brno (second biggest city in the Czech Republic). I will participate in a popular annual deciphering game that is taking a place there.  The 0.7.5 with another batch of bugfixes went out this Tuesday. Since then there has been no reports regarding major issues or crashes. Couple of teeny-tiny bugs were reported however that is not enough for us to make a new release now. So the 0.7.5 will become a stable version. Finally:)  I have spent most of the time during the past week working on the trailer. The first version has been done already. There is a discussion thread on our forum (with a link to the unlisted video on youtube) where people can give us feedback about it. This is by far not finished. But we needed to get it out in order to start talking to the music & sound guy and give him some baseline to work with. Yesterday we had a long chat with Albert about the trailer and we agreed that the first scene (standing in the middle of the ruins) should be changed. Now it feels too out of the context from the rest. Apart from that we are quite happy with the general flow. Of course there are plenty of details that need to be tweaked so there is still a long way to go. On the other hand having all the trailer in the script makes things a hell lot easier for us. Changing things like the zoom behavior, camera movement or speed is just a breeze. Same goes for extending / shortening the scenes or adding a new scene all together. Another issue is the final video quality. There is a lot of movement going on in the trailer and currently after youtube compression, often the video is just blurry. We have used the 720p for now but that proved not to be enough. Oh and regarding the music. Just for fun we tried to run the Raymond Scott's Twilight in Turkey together with the trailer. It turned out to work surprisingly well, so one option is that the music would go in this kind of direction.  Apart from preparing the 0.7.5 Michal spent most of the time on the new scenarios for the main campaign. It starts to slowly shape. At the moment there are 5 levels that introduce basic things like assembling machines, research, trains, etc. to the player in the course of playing. Often the player is not starting from the scratch but he can use already existing pieces of the factory. Writing the scenarios (and the trailer) is also a good opportunity for us to review, document and extend the Lua API.  Kuba and Albert keep working together on the terrain. There are couple of variations of the dirt by now and Albert is now spending his evenings with the grassy terrain. Kuba made couple of Blender scripts to ease the manual terrain work. This way Albert can take advantage of generated tileable noise or terrain transitions. Also yesterday Kuba showed me a great picture he generated that I can't resist to share with you. In case that you always thought that there is a lot of recipes in the game and that the whole thing is too complex, then worry no more. Here is an ultimate Factorio recipe cheatsheet for you:    As usual there is a post on our forum where you can discuss this update.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #5", "body": "Hi there,  fifth anniversary for the Friday Facts is here. Nothing big, but we got into the mood of doing these updates regularly and so far it works fine.  The release clock has stopped on 0.7.4. This looks pretty stable though there were still some minor annoyances and rare crashes. So the show goes on and there will be a 0.7.5. That will make the 0.7 a release with most   bugfix subreleases so far. Actually Kovarex took it as sort of a challenge to fix all the bugs that are reported on our forum (which works as a kind of bug tracker for us). Now there are last four.  Actually this led us to a rather interesting conversation about the bugs and our approach towards them. We have always took the stance of fixing bugs first, adding features later. This is contrary to some very popular   and successful indie games out there. So we naturally wondered whether it makes sense for us to keep doing this or whether we should try to move forward faster and build more features (there is plenty on the list). The conclusion   was that it is important to find a balance. Crashes and bugs which prevent someone from playing or are annoying are not tolerable and must be fixed immediately. However we will be spending less time on tiny little bugs. Things like \"if you are in the god mode and select a gun turret and pause the game and open the menu, then the description of the gun turret is broken\". Obviously a made up example to demonstrate the point:). We are really grateful that people are reporting even the smallest bugs, it's just that we think we need to draw a line and don't be afraid to say \"this is tolerable now and we will fix it later\". This will allow us to spend more time with the new features and content. Which is what we really need at the moment.  On the side note the work on the trailer is in the full speed. As mentioned before we have decided to go for a not so traditional approach without scene cuts. So the trailer will basically present an existing factory by sliding the camera from one place to another. The factory is done. Actually I took the factory from one of my freeplay games and adjusted it to fit the trailer's needs. Now we work on the script logic behind it. The script controls everything. Movement around the factory, speed, zoom, dynamic adjustments to particular machines, timing of actions, etc. This is also positive because it led us to extending the Lua API - for instance we have added routines to control the trains. These changes will be available in the 0.8 together with the trailer map and the script. There is still a lot of work ahead - finishing the script, balancing the speed and flow, polishing. After all this is done we will just press a button and capture the trailer from the screen. Lastly we will need a background music and sound. We haven't arranged anything yet, but Albert has some good contacts among sound professionals who could do this for us. There probably will be some spoiler discussions regarding the trailer on our forums soon. For the impatient there is a screen shot of a possible first trailer scene below (still needs some polishing - namely new terrain and additional decorative objects).    There is a link on our forum to this blog post so feel free to share your comments.       To finish with the fun fact there is now over 7000 commits in the Factorio project repository. And counting.

The result of our efforts is the 0.7.2 release which came out yesterday. There were more than 25 bugs fixed in the release. As the experience have shown, releases often take 3-4 iterations to stabilize. Therefore we still sort of expect one more release to stabilize the 0.7:)  Along with the coding, the works continue on the new terrain. Albert has finished with the dry dirt and he is now experimenting with patterns for other kinds of terrains like grass or snow. We are aiming for at least two \"biomes\" combining similar kinds of terrains. The terrain is quite a different task from modelling the machines or the enemies. Therefore there is a lot of researching and experiments involved. Kuba has provided a big help to Albert by generating various noises and tileable patterns for him to work with.  There is some good news regarding our team as well. Albert has been staying with us in our apartment (which became an improvized office) for the past month and the half. His presence here in Prague has been really beneficial to our progress on the visuals of the game. Things are moving much faster than before. So the news is that this week Albert rented an apartment for himself and his girlfriend here in Prague. It is situated in the middle of the city close to the historical center. It looks really nice and cosy. They might stay for the whole winter:)  After the 0.7 release we got some complaints that the game is using too much video memory. Some players couldn't even load the game for this reason. The 0.7.2 fixes this by providing the low resolution mode (in the graphics settings, needs a restart). In this mode, some of the sprites are scaled down before loading into the atlas. The resulting quality is lower, but the game will fit within 256MB video memory. You can compare how the game looks in low resolution (left) and normal mode below. The difference is naturally most visible when you zoom in. Enabling the multisampling will improve the quality and make the low resolution mode look real close to the regular one.    Last but not least, we have started with the new trailer. So far we put together some basic ideas for the scenes and started preparing the map where the trailer will be created. Actually the trailer will be a regular Factorio scenario so after it is finished anyone can load it and \"replay\" it directly in the game (except for the music though).  As usual you can post comments regarding this post at our forum.

{"page_num": "40", "name": "Friday Facts #3", "body": "Hello everyone,  this is the third Factorio weekly update. It is scary how fast the week went by. The summer is definitely gone and it has been raining hard for the past two days here in Prague. We spent the weekend by playtesting the 0.7.1. The bugfixes were mostly finished and we were after the balancing. This resulted in two freeplay games in which we both (me and kovarex) managed to build and defend the Rocket Defense in a little bit more than 11 hours. We both used different strategies. Kovarex went after the logistic robots and the beacons, while I tried to keep my factory relatively small and was really focused on researching the rocket defense asap. With the balancing changes we made, the game seems to be well playable again. No more crazy medium biter attacks after 10 minutes. In my game I saw a first medium biter after cca 4 hours and the first big biter after about 9 hours of playing. That seems allright for the regular settings.  After the weekend we focused on getting the 0.7.1 out. In the end we managed to do that on Tuesday night, after a full day of work on fixing small issues coming mostly from the Lua API refactoring. The 0.7.1 was received rather well. It still has some bugs though. Especially regarding the enemy expansion. There was this funny save where you stand in the middle of your factory and in like 20 seconds out of the blue sky there appears an enemy spawner and two worms right next to you:) So yeah, there will be 0.7.2. We will put in only bug fixes and will try hard to make this one the stable release for 0.7.  After the hectic release we spent the next day trying to relax a bit and put plans together for the next iteration. More or less the plan is now clear. There are three priorities:     New terrain - Originally we wanted to spend some time on the players' animation. But then a friend of ours came for a visit. He never saw the game before and his first remark was that the terrain is sh*t:) And he is sort of right. On top of     that the terrain is omnipresent. We really want to polish the game as much as possible before the Greenlight campaign so we decided to take a shot at the new terrain and some doodads if there is time left.   New main campaign - We consider the demo campaign more or less finished. It still needs some UI love but the content is there. However the main campaign (New Hope) is seriously lacking and it hasn't really changed since     the Indiegogo. So one of the goals for the next iteration will be to extend this campaign to 5+ meaningful levels. Having multiple levels will also allow us to better explain some concepts (like trains, logistic robots or signals) to the player.  New trailer - We cannot start a Greenlight campaign with the current trailer. It is painfully out of date. We have been discussing a lot of ideas and studying existing successful indie game trailers to     come up with something entertaining and competitive. The details are not finished yet, but the main theme would be presenting a factory without \"scene cuts\". All the transitions between the consecutive scenes would be     fluent and performed by elements in the factory. For instance - the camera follows the train which takes it to the next part of the factory.  Albert has been onto the terrain for couple of days now. We were playing with an idea to use Wang tiles but in the end decided to go with different size variations of tiles for the same terrain. This should break the grid-like feel of the current terrain. Albert developed his own, simple yet clever technique for creating tile variations rather fast. Basically he creates the tileable edge of a single tile and then just changes the inside for every variation. Keeping everything as 3D models allows him to do all sorts of tricks (like changing the height gradient really fast). Some preliminary results look promising.       Here is an example of dry dirt terrain with random machines on top of it:    As before the link to the post is in the separate topic on the forum. So you can post your comments there ", "url": "/blog/post/fff-3", "img": "https://factorio.com/static/img/factorio-banner-main.jpg", "author": "Tomas", "date": "2013-10-11"},
{"page_num": "41", "name": "Friday Facts #2", "body": "Hello everyone,  another weekly Factorio update is here. The 0.7.0 release from the last Friday night has triggered a lot of discussions on the forum. It seems that in the end we didn't get the balancing quite right and the natives are now rather overpowered. People reported cases when they were overrun by the biters after less than half an hour of playing. Another issue would be that the biters in the enemy bases would level up too quickly and when the player arrives to conquer the base there were plenty of medium or big biters (which are quire resistant). Apart from that the release was relatively smooth. There are some minor bugs but no deal brakers.  After recharging some energy during the weekend at a local wine festival:), we started working on the 0.7.1. Unlike in previous minor releases, the 0.7.1 will contain also couple of new features. Most notable of these is the addition of late game player following robots (aka \"destroyers\"). They are quire expensive, but they allow to conquer even large enemy bases. And they are a lot of fun to play with because of their acceleration based behavior.   Apart from this and other small features the week has been spent mostly by bugfixing the issues reported by the community. This is now more or less finished and we have started with playtesting and further balancing. The 0.7.1 is expected to be released during the next week. As mentioned before afterwards we will focus some of our energy on making the new trailer and preparing for the Steam Greenlight campaign.  Another thing that kept us busy for a while has been the wiki. Originally it has been spammed to a degree when any ressurection seemed hopeless. However after many tries (what do you do with a 4GB sql dump file?) Blue Cube has managed to prune the database and resurrect   the wiki at its original location. For now we have restricted the access only to people who has been confirmed manually by us. So if you are interested in contributing to the wiki (which would be more than welcomed) then request an account on the  wiki page . You will need a forum account for that as well. All this is to avoid further automated spamming of the wiki. Not only the wiki has been resurrected but   also thanx to Kovarex it now contains up to date information on Factorio 0.7.1 scripting interface.  Albert has been busy and productive as well. He has finished with the enemy spawner which we had to redo couple of times because of notable noise in the final animation. The resulting animation is imho worth it. You can see it below (animation for breathing) together with the gif capturing the process of making the spawner model. After this Albert has worked on other small issues that we have been putting off for a while. Things like: slowdown particles, underground objects indication (belts to ground, pipes to ground) and finally the remnants after destroyed objects. These are especially useful because as a player you can see what has been destroyed when your base has been attacked by the natives.    And here is a fun fact for this episode. Technically it happened last week, but it so funny that it still qualifies.       So the thing is that recently we looked up that there will be an  indie game conference here in Prague. We were super excited and all three of us went there really       enthusiastic to talk to the people from the indie game industry and maybe propagate Factorio or something. It took place in the local startup hub. We arrived and saw that a workshop was about to start soon. So we sat       down and waited for a while. It was a little bit weird that nothing was happening but after a while a guy appeared who said he is coming for the workshop as well. He started explaining to us what he does and it was       all about some very advanced server management stuff. We waited all the time when he will get to the indie game part but it never happened. And it turned out that the workshop is actually about some advanced       server management stuff. The indie game conference happened a year ago on the same day. So we were one year late. The people at the reception had quite a good laugh.  All right, back to the reality. Recently we have created a new \"Updates\" category on the forum where we will try to regularly post small updates. We will also create there a post for every friday facts episode where you can post comments.

{"page_num": "41", "name": "Friday Facts #1", "body": "Hello,  recently we had a lot of discussions on our forum about interaction with the community. You can have a look at the  details .   The result is that we have realized, we have done a poor job in providing updates about our progress. And we have decided to change it.  This is a first blog post from the \"Factorio Friday Facts\" series. Every friday we will sum up our weekly progress here. This will include insights into what we have been working on, what is planned, sometimes art sneak peeks   of course occasional fun facts from Indie game developers live.  All right, let's have a look at what we have been up to in the past week. The single point of focus for the whole team has been finishing the 0.7.0 release. This release has taken the most development time so far. Partly because   we were getting our attention together after the holidays and partly because there was a LOT of work to be done:) Actually most of the changes are under the hood (combat framework, AI routines, pollution modelling, etc.) but   their results will be well visible in the game.  Just a taste of what is coming. The biggest change is probably the overall shift in enemy logic. Before they were simply controlled by the lua script behind the scenario. Now they are more autonomous and integrated in the game.   This is because of a new concept we have introduced - the pollution. Pollution is produced by the factory (mining drills, furnaces, etc.) and then spreads in the world. Some objects can actually lower pollution (for now only trees).   After a while the deadly pollution clouds arrive to the enemy spawners. The spawners \"clear\" the pollution but in turn produce an \"angry\" biters (new name for our basic class of enemies). After certain period of time, all the   angry biters from the local neighborhood are sent together to the closest local optimal pollution source to destroy everything that they find there. This follows a simple logic: you destroy their environment - they get angry - they attack you / your machines. For now there is no way to deal with the pollution in the \"peaceful\" way, but there will be in the future. You can imagine pollution clearing machines or even making pacts with enemies to tolerate   pollution in exchange for providing them with supply of resources. Anyway this changes the game significantly. It is not enough to fortify the labs / radars now. You need to protect your whole factory / keep checking the pollution levels and examine from which direction the attack will come (the pollution is visible on the map after pressing the alt key).  For Albert (our graphic) the release has been especially challenging because after months of working on machine design he had to completely shift his style and model the enemy units and structures.   The result are three new biters and three worms taking up a lot of MBs in the package:) Last week Albert spent with the most difficult structure - the enemy spawner. In the end we didn't put it into the release, because   it still needs to be tweaked and better integrated, but it is definitely coming in one of the following bugfix releases. Apart from that Albert also spent some time preparing a new set of selection boxes and arrows.   He was correct that the old ones \"were hurting the eyes\". You can check an example of new boxes in the screenshot below (personally I am really fond of them, that is why I share them here).    Since the release is rather big we have spent the last week mostly by fixing bugs and solving small remaining issues. AI behaviors are especially tricky to test because they are often not exact or easily reproducible. The final count of solved issues in the 0.7.0 has stopped at symbolic 111. Couple of them done at the very last moment:) After this sprint we will now take some rest over the weekend and start preparing the plans for the next update.       Next month will be especially interesting because we will start actively preparing for the Steam greenlight campaign. This will require further graphical polishing in the game (namely player animation) and most importantly a new trailer. We already have couple of ideas and for sure we will discuss them with the community on the forums.  And finally the fun fact. During release compilation on our Linux virtual machine we got an error: \"Virtual memory exhaust, cannot allocate more memory\". Factorio code is getting really big. So there is no Linux build   until we fix this:|  Well that would be it for now. The 0.7.0 release is actually out already, you can read more details on our  forum . It is still experimental and it will probably take some time before it stabilizes, but if you don't mind the bugs then go ahead and give it a spin.

{"page_num": "41", "name": "Our youtube channel", "body": "Hi guys,  we are still busy working on the 0.7 update, but in the meantime here is a little news on our youtube channel:  We have had a youtube channel for a while. You can  have a look. However there hasn't been that much activity. Actually main reason for that is rather funny.   The account was connected with my personal email address. After a while we figured out it would be useful to use some common email address so the other members of the team can manipulate the channel as well. It turned out that it was not possible to change the email or even migrate the videos to a different channel. So we were sort of stuck with a channel with quite some content already, but one that couldn't be used in a longterm.  However recently the situation has changed. Youtube has allowed connecting the account to a Google+ page which can be administred by multiple people. So effectively we got what we wanted - our youtube channel with the original   content, that can be controlled by different people on the team. This is a new motivation for us to produce videos now and then. We have started by making a new video about one of the scenario pack campaigns - the Tight spot.  Have a look at the video  and let us know what you think;) ", "url": "/blog/post/our-youtube-channel", "img": "https://factorio.com/static/img/factorio-banner-main.jpg", "author": "Tomas", "date": "2013-09-09"},

We took the time to go for vacation and recharge our energy after months of work. But now we are back. The work on the 0.7 release is in the full speed.  This release will be mainly aimed at improving the combat and the enemies behavior.  Apart from doing regular developer work we will also soon start the preparations for the Steam Greenlight campaign. We plan to begin the campaign in the matter of weeks. The biggest challenge will probably be making a new trailer. The old one is rather obsolete by now. Once the trailer is ready we will also do some more marketing trying to raise awareness about Factorio at gaming blogs.  Interesting things ahead. Stay tuned.

{"page_num": "41", "name": "Factorio 0.6.4 is stable", "body": "Hello everyone,  Factorio 0.6.4 release has just been marked stable!  Following our usual release procedure the 0.6 release has been around for a while. Users from the forum helped us to find the most annoying bugs and now the release is considered \"serious bugs free\".  The release has been packed with features and new stuff. Here are the most significant gameplay improvements:     The world map (and a minimap). These allows for a much better orientation in the world.   The steel furnace (faster) and the electric furnace (requires no coal). Smelting resources is one of the basic tasks in the factory and these new furnaces        provide interesting alternatives to using brute-force approach of many stone furnaces.  Logistic robots can suplly the player directly. In the later stages of the game the player can focus more on managing and extending the factory and not running        around collecting the created items.   Modules and beacons. It is now possible to influence machine properties (speed, productivity, energy efficiency) with inserting module items. This way the assembling machines        in the production bottleneck can be sped up without extending the production line.   Improved terrain generator. The trees now follow the same fractal terrain generation as the terrain. This makes them look more realistic.  Apart from the features we have focused a lot of energy on speed improvements as well. With larger factories the players often experienced slowdowns because too many objects have to be updated every tick.       We have made optimizations to the way items move along the belts. These were the biggest \"performance eaters\" (there are often tons of items on the belts in the factory) so this helped quite a lot for the big factories.       We also optimised the way graphical rendering works. This is mostly notable on the Windows operating system (our graphical library uses a different backend - d3d on the windows compared to the linux / mac - openGL).       Another major improvement has been made to the core loop of the game. The graphical rendering can now run parallel to the game update using different threads. This can take advantage of at most two threads.       And finally the render preparation phase (collecting the sprites to be rendered) has been parallelised as well. This can take advantage of multiple threads, we empirically tested that the best results are shown for 4 or 5 threads (given that there are enough cores for these threads to run on).     Last but not least our artist has also done a lot of work. There is a new terrain and plenty of objects have new graphics (labs, car, chests, logistic robots, etc.). The game is less contrastive compared to early versions with RGB colors, on the other hand it is also more aesthetically pleasing now.  As usual you can find the full changelog of the changes at our forum  in the news section . The changelog is now available also directly in the game in the \"About\" dialog.  As mentioned before, the work on 0.7 is in the full speed now together with preparations for the Steam Greenlight campaign. So stay tuned for more news.

These were taken in Factorio 0.6.x, the current experimental release. The old screenshots were more than half a year old and they were really obsolete. A lot of graphic placeholders has been replaced since then and many new assets were added. There is still a long way to go. However the artistic direction of Factorio has more or less stabilised and we now know where we are heading.  Probably the biggest change that strikes the eye are the new color tones of the terrain. The terrain now looks more uniform and smooth, though it is still not a final version. Our artist is experimenting with new terrain meshes and variations. On top of that there will be a set of various objects (doodads) to make the environment more variable and interesting to explore. Things like wrecks of space ships, remnants of dead creatures, ruins left behind by the native civilization, different fauna, etc. Apart from the new screenshots there is an update of the theme pictures as well.

The game development itself is going along quite well. The updates are coming out more or less once a month. This gives the people who have bought the alpha access a sneak peek at the Factorio evolution in progress.  Some time ago we have also introduced the first version of the scenario pack. The forum community helped us to tweak the bugs and balance the missions. The result are three mini campaigns that provide various   factory-building challenges to the player:       Tight spot  - Little space, limited resources and fixed amount of time. Buy land and machines and sell your final product.   Transport Belt Maddness  - So many chests and such a small island. Can you connect the chests without your head spinning?   Supply challenge  - Six hungry chests that change their taste often. Is your production flexible enough?        These missions are the first batch and there will be more coming in the future. The scenario pack is available to the Furnace Attendant tier or higher.     Another update in the same tier is a new Factorio wallpaper displaying the Assembling machine in the night.  The Mining Drill Operator tier has been updated as well. For a while there has been an option to put your name in the game. Quite a few people already did this and now there are train stations named after them in Factorio. As of 0.6.0 the name generator will be used for Labs as well. Another update for this tier is the first version of the Concept Art book that is available for download now. As mentioned before this is some very early Factorio concept art and the book will definitely be updated as the game development progresses.  Last update regards the access to our internal art wiki. The Mining Drill Operator members (or higher) from now on can observe the evolution of the in-game graphics via a read-only access to the wiki. There are plenty of sketches, inspirational photos and different variants of the game objects. The wiki is hosted on the google pages, therefore the google login is necessary. For now the invitations will be send on request. That means if you are a Mining Drill Operator member (or higher) then send us an email with your login name and we will send you an invite.

{"page_num": "41", "name": "Factorio 0.5.2 released", "body": "Hello guys,  Factorio 0.5.2 release has just been marked stable!  The 0.5.0 has been released more than two weeks ago however it took a while to stabilize. We listened to our users and fixed loads of annoying bugs.  The biggest thing in the release was probably the visual update. Factorio finally got a decent looking gui and menus. Though many people claim that they don't care about the (gui) visuals we think this is really important. The broader audience often judges the game already by looking at the first menu screen. And the old looks were not really helping there. As part of the gui update we tweaked some UIs - for instance the recipe gui now contains the   tabs for different categories. This allows for easier navigation in the growing list of available recipes.  Apart from the gui the visuals of quite a few entities were updated. There are still a lot of patches and inconsistencies in the game, however we are slowly improving the arts and (hopefully) preparing the game for wider audience. There is a new boiler, steam engine, pump, pipes, mining drills, locomotive, splitters, lamps and radar. The next target for visual face lift is the terrain=)  Another important (yet technical) improvement is the new auto updater. This allows the players who have purchased the alpha version of the game to receive new versions automatically when they are released. The game connects to the server on the startup and after login / password authorization, checks for updates. This feature can be switched off if the user wishes so. When automatic updates are switched off Factorio will not try to establish any connection over the network. We respect users privacy. Factorio has no DRM protection mechanisms. The point of auto updater is to make the life of people who bought the game easier by removing the hassle of downloading and reinstalling the game when new version is released.  As usual the release contains tons of little improvements. You can find the full changelogs on our forums in the  news section .   We have also recorded a video about the major changes in 0.5.x. You can check it out at our youtube channel.  Stay tuned - there will be more Factory news coming in the summer.

{"page_num": "41", "name": "Factorio 0.4.1 released", "body": "Hello guys,  Factorio 0.4.1 has just been released!  This is a bugfix release to the 0.4.0 update that has been made on Friday. The 0.4.0 has been tested by the guys at the forum and in 0.4.1 we provide bugfixes to the things they found. Let's have a look at the biggest changes introduced in the 0.4.0 and 0.4.1.  The main theme has been the trains. Connected rolling stocks form a train. The trains can be assigned schedules of stations to visit. In the station the train can be loaded / unloaded an refueled. There are also semaphores to guide trains in the railway network. Apart from this we have also fixed some bugs in how railroads and rolling stocks work. Further information about how railway transportation works is available at our  wiki.  Apart from the trains we have added quite some functionality to the electricity. There are three new elements for energy distribution: the medium electric pole, the big electric pole and the substation. They all have different properties and are appropriate for different situations. Also there is the long awaited accumulator. Now finally even in night the factories can be protected from the alliens by the laser turrets.  We have invested a lot of time into the tuning the determinism. The game is now (almost) fully deterministic. This is a necessary first step towards the multiplayer. Players can see our effort in action already   in the replay functionality. Because of the determinism limitations the replaying functionality works only on the games that has been played within the same version with the same sets of mods all the time (and started in 0.4.1).  As usual the release contains a lot of fixes and extensions in the scripting. As a result some of the 0.3.x version of the mods (especially those using a lot of scripting functionality) might cause errors with the new version.   This can be repaired by using updated mods (when that happens). As before, the new version is compatible with all the previous saves. We really don't want the players to lose the games they have spent so much time with.  After the long time of waiting we have added more Linux support. Next to the .deb package there is now a generic .tar package available for download. This is aimed at the more experienced users who will be able to deal with the dependencies themselves.  That was longer than expected. The release details are available as usual on our forums.

All the membership accounts are eligible for Factorio alpha access, beta access and full release (when these are made). This is including all the future updates.   Whenever someone buys Factorio membership he immediately receives upgrade code and can go and play the alpha right away.

The wallpapers are ready and if you have the Furnace Attendant (or higher) membership you can download them already.   The wallpapers are available on your user settings page. Just click your username at the top right of the screen and scroll down. The wallpapers come in different resolutions. These are some of the most common resolutions   in terms of widht : height ratio. If your resolution is not there you might still use a wallpaper with the same width : height ratio and higher resolution. For instance if your resolution is 1280 : 800 you can use the 1680 : 1050   which has the same width : heigh ratio. Originally we promised three wallpapers based on our theme pictures. However we decided to add some more. So at the moment our concept artist is working on two additional theme pictures   which will be available as wallpapers as well in the near future.  The other highly anticipated perk is the scenario pack. We are working on that right now. The first version of the scenario pack will be available together with the Factorio 0.4.0 release at the end of April.      As mentioned already the scenario pack will be work in progress as well. We intend to keep adding new content until we feel \"it's right\".  The Mining Drill Operator on top of these contains the \"name in the game\" and the Concept Art Book. First backer names will appear in Factorio 0.4.0. If you have the Mining Drill Operator tier or higher you can   already insert your name into the form at the user setting page (below the wallpapers). Before every release (starting Factorio 0.4.0) all these names will be collected and exported into the list directly in the game.   The names from the list will be used as name tags for different machines in the game, train stations, etc.  The concept art book should be released by the end of April as well. Even though our concept artist spent a lot of time with the concepts in the art book we are still not sure whether it is up to the standards. Therefore we will   name it version one and it might get updated in the future. Also we are toying with an interesting idea regarding this topic at the moment. We have sort of internal graphical wiki using Google sites. We use it for communication with Albert (main graphic behind the game), for sharing graphic proposals, concepts and finished sprites. What we are considering is to give readonly access to this wiki as part of the Mining Drill Operator tier or higher. This way   people could actually see the process of graphical shaping of Factorio. Things that never made it into the game, evolution of some machines graphics, etc. We are still not sure whether this is a good idea so in case you would find this interesting please let us know (email, forum, facebook).  Last thing regards the Inserter Constructor. This tier was only available during the Indiegogo campaign. After the campaign ended we sort of felt that the tier was a bit overpriced. That is the reason why for the preorder on the site we created the new tier Mining Drill Operator with pretty much the same content but cheaper. This can naturally happen however we feel it would be correct to somehow compensate the people who bought the Inserter Constructor tier. One thing we came up with would be giving them an extra upgrade code for Factorio which they can use as a gift for someone they know. Again this is something we are considering at the moment so if you have any ideas in this regard please let us know.  Ok enough talking. Go and download those wallpapers and put them to your screens;)  ", "url": "/blog/post/the-perks-1", "img": "https://factorio.com/static/img/factorio-banner-main.jpg", "author": "Tomas", "date": "2013-04-15"},
{"page_num": "42", "name": "Factorio 0.3.0 released", "body": "Hello everyone,  we have just released Factorio 0.3.0 !  We took quite some time and put a our effort into this release. There is a lot of internal refactoring and preparations which won't be visible to the player but they   will make our live a lot easier in the future. We are \"tying our laces before setting for a run\".  Apart from that we have put quite some effort into improving modding capabilities. Uptil now making and using mods was   just for the hardcore fans of the game. We really see the importance of good modding system so we started building one. The mods are now standalone packages and allow for   much easier and cleaner combination. Together with modding improvements we updated our Lua scripting API based on the feedback gathered from our forums.  Apart from code changes there is some new graphics in the game. Our graphic Albert has spent more than two weeks here in the Prague. That allowed us to get a lot of work done.   There are new inserters, turrets, walls, etc. Even though these all pieces are new graphic they might not be the final version. At the moment Albert is working on a high   level artistic direction for the game. That might look like quite late (with the game already in the alpha). But better late than never :).  The release is marked as experimental. This means that in order to download it you need to click the \"experimental\" link on our download page next to the \"Download\" title.   After the release gets tested and no serious bugs are reported it will be marked as stable.  Allright, enough of the talking. You can find more details about the changes on our forums.

We have received a lot of emails with people asking whether and how it will be possible to buy the access to the alfa version of the game. Originally it wasn't our plan to have any preorder while the game is in the early stages of the development. However we listened to the inputs from the people who have missed the Indiegogo campaign and we have decided to setup a preorder directly on our website.  The preorder will be done in a similar fashion as the Indiegogo campaign. We will start with couple of membership tiers offering different perks to the users. The tiers will more or less correspond to those in the Indiegogo campaign. The lowest tier will be 10€ and the alpha access will be present in all of them. At the moment we are still working on preparations of the extra perks on top of the alpha access. Those will be delivered later.  For now the preorder will be done via PayPal and BitPay. PayPal allows both direct PayPal payments as well as credit card payments. All done in EUR currency. On the other hand BitPay is a Bitcoin payment solution. We are also working on adding direct debit card payments in USD. However those are not ready yet.  Ok finally the important information.  The preorder is planned to start on 18th of March 2013 (next Monday). We had some issues with PayPal (yet again:)) and they should hopefully be resolved by that date.

I didn't write it. We didn't reach the magical number and I simply went to bed. Today in the morning it was already suspicious that nothing was happening. Usually during the night here in the Europe     we would get like 200 euro or more in contributions. I suppose that is from the guys over in the US. But today it was an absolute zero. Something was fishy. I tried to do the 1 euro contribution via the Paypal but it failed with a following message:We are sorry, we are experiencing temporary difficulties. Please try again later.

{"page_num": "42", "name": "Getting the Alpha", "body": "Hello everyone,we are overwhelmed! Literally. We are getting loads of emails every day with people requesting the access to the alpha version of the game.     We answered every single email (or at least we believe so - if you haven't received a reply within 24 hours, please notify us again).     It just makes us really happy to see how many people enjoy the game we are working on. Despite that we decided to stop providing free alpha per request.     Alpha will still be provided to users who contributed to the Indiegogo campaign. This was a hard decision to make. Please let me explain. Our original intention was to provide a public demo only. The alpha was supposed to be released in March 2013 in case our Indiegogo campaign would have been     successfully funded. However things have developed differently. In our blog post from the 31st Dec 2012 we stated that the alpha is available to people who 'liked the demo and send us the email requesting the access'.     That was at the time when we had like 5 people playing the game and we started sending the demo to our friends and relatives to gather the feedback.     In the beginning of our campaign we got like an email a day from the people saying that they are super excited about our project, already contributed     and then went through all of our blog and find this note about giving away alpha. So we gave them the alpha because we were just so happy     that someone actually went and read through all of our previous blog posts (well to be fair there were like 7 of them at the time). Our campaign looked futile in the first week. Actually we were really close to giving up. We were aware of the many mistakes we did in setting up the campaign     and we were constantly failing to generate the interest in our project. Therefore we decided to try out offering alpha immediately to the people     who backed our project. We believe this step significantly improved our chance of success. Within a week there gathered an amazing small community of backers playing the alpha, discussing the game on our forums,     posting their factory creations and generally enjoying themselves. Now the situation is different. We are receiving dozens of emails a day from people asking for the alpha because they read somewhere on a forum that we will provide     them with free alpha when they ask for it. And we have suspicions this could get even more extreme.     We are trying to be truly open and we don't actually mind giving the alpha away to people who really want to play it. But:We find it a bit unfair towards our backers who got the alpha after contributing.We are still far from reaching our goal at Indiegogo and we would like to motivate people to support us.This adds a lot of work to us. So this is our motivation. We hope you will find it fair. We are happy for any feedback.

{"page_num": "42", "name": "Indiegogo campaign progress", "body": "Hello everyone ! We thought it would be a good time to recapitulate a bit on the current progress of our Indiegogo campaign. We are at 1.5k Euro with 20 days left to get onto 17k Euro at the moment. Here is what happened so far. We made some big mistakes. Probably the biggest one being starting a crowd funding campaign without a solid community to back us. There were        couple of our friends who knew about our campaign upfront and that was it. Another crucial error was the financing goal we chose. The amount        we agreed on reflects our rough estimates on what it will take to deliver the final product. However we should have gone with lower amount and        rely on setting up a pre-order later on on our web site. Despite having fixed funding it is quite possible that the amount we asked for put a lot        of people off. There were more mistakes but these two stand out. The start of the campaign was really slow. No one knew about our game and it was a struggle to spread out the word at all.        Actually like 5 days into the campaign we were pretty much ready for resignation. But then the Futile Position (symptomatique name for our situation)        wrote a short post about Factorio. We got a small spike in pledges and some emails with a positive feedback.        On top of that a friend of ours started to actively help us with the campaign. We were back on. Since then the awareness was slowly increasing. There is a great thread and nice community around Factorio at the Face Punch forum .We have been getting a lot of supportive emails recently. People urging us to not give up and expressing their hopes that we will continue        even if this crowdfunding fails. Reading emails like this is a huge motivator. On top of that we got another spike yesterday. Nathan Adams from Minecraft noticed our game, backed it and tweeted about it. And we got like 20 pledges within two hours. Couple of people offered to help us spread the word by featuring the game on forums and youtube         previews. Things really started to look a bit brighter yesterday. So here we are now. Still far behind the expected funding schedule. But encouraged by a lot of positive feedback and interest in our game. We have spent past months working hard on Factorio. Programming like crazy. Burning through our savings. Getting strange looks when explaining         to people what we do. And not knowing whether what we are building will have any meaning at all. It is then even more rewarding to read on         the forums people discussing their factory setups, sharing screenshots of their creations and generally being excited about the game.         No matter whether the Indiegogo campaign fails or succeeds. Things like these make the project a success in our eyes already. Finally we would like to say a big thank you to all our current supporters and people sending us feedback.         We are really grateful to you and we will try hard to stand up to expectations.

The game is still far away from being graphically complete (surprise) but the gameplay is slowly getting where we would like it to be.     So here is a short teaser for some of the new features: Technologies Build labs, create science packs and discover new recipes and improvements.Logistic Robots When your factory gets big use small flying robots to ease the transportation of material.Signals This has already been in 0.1.x, but now it has been tested and verified.                               Define conditions to switch on / off certain inserters based on number of items in your chests.                               This is perfect for controlling how many items are produced.Day night cycle Are you scared of the dark ? Well, too bad ...Graphic polish Character animations (mining, shooting, standing), light sources, mining particles, rocket smoke ...Freeplay There is a simple freeplay mode in the full version now. You play on the unlimited map full of enemy bases with scarce resources.                                 Your task is to build a rocket defense for soon-to-land spaceships from the earth. The rocket defense is meant to protect the ships from                                 potential allien attacks. However in order to build the rocket defense you need to research appropriate technologies first. And to spice it                               up a bit in order to research certain technologies you will need allien artefacts which you get when you destroy allien bases.

Again huge amount of things has happened since the last post. We are putting our energy     into shipping the demo release before X-mas as promised. If necessary we are ready to put     in couple of all-nighters as well. At the moment coding sessions lasting till 4 am in the     morning are becoming more and more frequent. People sleep, cats scout the dark streets and     we are sitting by the computers fixing bugs and tuning the tutorial :) Slowly we are getting into the phase where we need to focus a lot of our resources on     non-programming tasks as well. Things like communication with our freelance partners,     processing feedback from early testers and discussing marketing strategies have become part     of our daily routine. On the other hand this gives the job an interesting flavor.     In our regular programming jobs we were shielded away from all non-programming tasks by     dedicated people and now we finally start to appreciate the amount of work they have     to deal with. Recently we have spent quite some time with the web pages as well. The whole thing is running     on Heroku and we are slowly discovering the possibilities it gives us.     When the demo release is finished it will be downloadable directly from this web page.     In order to achieve that we need to setup user authentication system, get our release packages to some file provider (probably Amazon S3) and handle couple of other small things.     Later on we plan to have an automatic downloader in the game itself, however that is still sitting there as a ticket in one of our future milestones. We are always looking for ways to improve game controls and make the interaction for the player as seamless as possible. Now it is quite easy to organise the players inventories using filter slots, crafting is less tedious thanks to automatic interproducts crafting and there is a nice shortcut to view what is going on in machines visible on the screen (like what is in the chest, which items are being processed by furnaces, etc.). We personally feel that every such improvement, even though small in itself, adds to the playing experince. Hmmm, that would be about it. Oh we have welcomed a new member in our team.

The biggest and most visible change is that our graphic Albert finished the basic tileset with transitions.     In effect the game finally starts to look more realistic. At the moment the tileset is as follows: deep water, water, grass, dirt, cobble and sand.     You can check for yourself updated screenshots at the Preview page. The drawback is that the entities with     dummy graphics now look even more ridiculous :). But that will change soon. In the past weeks we spent a lot of time working on the tutorial campaign. Tutorial campaign has 4 levels and will be part of the demo release coming out before X-mas.     The campaign introduces the player into the game plot and teaches him the basic mechanics of the game. How to mine the resources, craft recipes and build parts of the factory.     There will also be encounters with allien inhabitants of the planet and they probably won't be happy to see intruders into their territory ...     We are already working with private beta testers (meaning friends of ours) to make sure that the campaign is enjoyable and it does a good job in explaining the game concepts. Apart from graphics and the tutorial we did a lot of small tasks and bugfixes. For instance the generators (they produce electricity) now emit vapor which can cover your factory     and give the whole scene a bit of industrial feel. And if you make a lot of them you just won't see much of your factory in the end. Well that will probably change :). With the core     stuff for the demo pretty much finished we focus our energy on improving the game experience. Like for example we have added some ambient sounds giving more realistic atmosphere of the game.     Or the game player interaction. We have spent a good deal of time with that.

His task is to prepare the planet for colonization fleet coming from the Earth.     In order to achieve that he basically needs to clear the planet from hostile alien creatures that constantly keep attacking him.     He starts with his bare hands and knowledge how to create couple of simple things. As he progresses he mines available resources, builds more complicated machines,     unlocks elaborate recipes and creates automated factories. At the moment the game is playable. However, it contains only basic functionality, it is still a bit buggy and it does not yet look as silky smooth as we would like it to be.     While our graphic Albert is feverishly working on the looks we are finishing the demo version with tutorial campaign which will be available soon for free.     We are doing all this without any external support. This means that we don't get paid and we have to finance all the expenses ourselves (mostly graphics).     For this reason we need an early verification whether the game will be enjoyable and thus whether it makes sense for us to continue in development. That is the reason     why we want to get the demo out as soon as possible and see what you guys have to say abou it. So stay alert, it will probably be flying out before X-mas. As you have probably noticed, quite some content on this page looks rather funny. Like screenshots, video, half finished pages, etc. Please bear with us, we are working on it :) ", "url": "/blog/post/here-we-are", "img": "https://factorio.com/static/img/factorio-banner-main.jpg", "author": "Tomas", "date": "2012-10-24"}
